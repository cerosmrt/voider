0The Violated System

0Restricting Choices
Do every one of us deserve peace?
When you do things out of need, the restricting choices will forcefully expand you and teach you to forget.
Distractions, barriers, and confusions in the form of choices that we should not need to be making

0Things Already Known
0The Important Sentence
0The Growing Life

0A Warning and a Threat
I pulled the first card from the pile I placed already shuffled. I drew the ten of wands, and the man standing in it had a ram's head.
When the night came, 

0A Haunting Night
I am wide awake. The room is black and I am lonely. If only I could get some sleep. Creeky noises make my skin creep. The demons, trapped inside my head, come back to the surface and I let them tell me things. I need to get some sleep. They whisper me secrets I can't resist. I can't get no sleep. They convinced me to shut up, and since then I cannot speak.
. 
0The Heart's Desire
The path of truth permeats all ages, and through the living word.
As every empire started with a fire. 
.
0Dreams and Destiny
Dreams bled into reality and propelled fate
.
0The Warrior's Love
A warrior lays on the floor, craving for living outloud; instead struggles to survive.
.
"Don't panic", he said. "The everseeking sword will tilt its point at you. And to your destiny will put an end". He breathed every word with rhythm
.
Death was so probable that the self proclaimed antichrist displayed its wings in front of him, feeling concerned that, somehow, speaking the truth would be a threat.
"do not fear what later in life can do to the body"
.
You can only get angry with what you don’t fear. You can only love that wich you are not angry with.      
you know if it's love or fear when you stop being shy
it is the warriors love the one of courage
it is the one who dared the one loved
thus love without courage is not love
.
As terrible as it seems to take place in their minds, they storm and fight while we are still amongst chaos. At war, the adventurer's love is unconditional. Killing, instead of sparing them time, held time from them
. 
Between backstabbers and abusers, an invincible fighter singlehandlely changed the world. 
If only he listened when they said you couldn't carry the weight of the planets.
.
0Beauty in the Unknown
The unknown, too, sings God's praise
.
Day after day, dreams bled into my reality. 
As in my dreams, awake all time merged. 
Time in thought ceases to exist, and I was disposed only for my dreams to inhabit me
.
I saw it happening, and instead of wishing it I prayed not to deserve what was to come
.
Everything I'll get to live I'll deserve or learn how to. 
I am convinced that the gift is brought to those who have suffered.
.
0A Philosopher's God
What can philosopher's say about God?
Why should he be scared of telling things to himself
He has to prove himself, not to the things already known, but the ones undesired. He has to see the things others do not want to see.
The philosopher who has spoken most about himself has so far said the most about god. 
YOu find order in divergent thinking. 
All gods have something to teach us, but the most unorthodox is the one that will achieve the best results in transforming us.
Will be guide to all people he who belongs to none.
Knowing God alone doesn't make me move in divinity. There are times in which I don't see it in my consciousness. My spirit lies dormant. There were times in which my spirit felt dead. Stages of my life in which i didn't seem to learn anything. 
In which my worst fear was fear of death. 
Death as an idea, not the death of someone in particular. 
I just couldn't recognise it.
I couldn't pin it down. 
Afterall, no one expects to die ever. 
But all the ones that have not yet died have already died. 
.
Everything will never be defined by the negative. 
It's a wellspring of creativity and possibility, always thriving towards the infinite
There are two sides of story.
.
The system was always about order and not about power. Power that is controlled by everyone around you is not free power. Other powers are supposed to control you. 
The system was violated with a look of power. 
Decentralized, disposed of all those years and changes that lead you forward. 
Degeneration got us backwards. 
.
Purposefuly I chose not to lie, thinking that a simple smile would cover it
And I could believe that. And that is what was hurtful.
.
"May your heart heal and be filled with peace. Though hope deferred makes the heart sick, no longer will you break."
.
0The Battle's End
This war is given between those who impose and those who don't impose. 
Coming from the base that what develops us as people is teaching, thy thou shalt. Someone says how things are and the other, inevitably, obeys or disobeys that which is said. It is good in childhood because there are rules. They should be as close as it posible can to the spirit of the person that is prophesing. The duty of the son should be to perfect his spirit, contradicting the thou shalt and going back to teach fathers and children and children of children how is that the spirit is in reality
.
I'm not part of that battle anymore
.
We all see the same things. 
What can we do about it, if not make chapters out of pages.
.

0The Everseeking Sword
Every part of it is orchestrated. When nothing is happening, something is brewing. 
.
In life you're either growing or you're dying.
.
Moderation makes you enjoy longer.
.
i at times assumed that the next sentecnce was always the most important one
.
there needs to be patience
.
Anything can happen. 21 black jack. Randomness. Chaos. The unpredictability of the future
.
They took a writer's writing and read them archetypically
.
Is man programmable? Like a machine?.
.
good is a man who know what he's capable of and decides not to do it.
A strong man, aggresive, feroceous, corageous, passional, its only good despite all of this. None of this makes it good. Nor bad
. 
Sometimes the enchantement doesn’t work. 
Then we believe in no magic. 
But the enchantment works only through suggestion.
The other one has to be receptive to it for it to work.
That doesn't make magic less real.
