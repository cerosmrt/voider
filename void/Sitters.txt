1a
uninspired
do the work
make a move


Undesired
Moving all my ways


what is lower
than my self


Don't you know I'm dead?
Don't you know…

1b
I'm a liar
Moving blocks
Creating moves


On a riot
Finding my way


Is my accent
Higher than 
my self


Unreliar
Doing all my ways


why do you ask me?
what is on my mind
dont you know i’m mad?

In the end
Of times
(you know i’m a killer)
Don't you know I'm fine

In the end
Of times
you know I'm on fire
dont you know i’m fine


to explain truths 
is too simple 
but too hard is
to be understood




Forgive father
For I have been


Don't worry mother
You'll be on my mind
You'll be on my mind




Am(E) F C(G) A
reject me mother
life’s too short to be understood
undesired
off your wicked ways


Forgive me brother
I'll be on my way
Off your wicked ways
Off your wicked ways 


The creative
don't live 
an empty mind


whats higher 
About
My self


to explain truths 
is too simple 
but too hard is
to be understood


what connects me to this place
is my body and my face
you dont wear them
Just let me be


i dont want a bed


but this time 
ill take my chances
to be wrong
misunderstood




.
What's so wrong that is good
What's so good that is wrong


Individual autonomy


What's my accent
whats higher 
About
My self


If my head is calm
My voice is rougher


…


Am(E) F C(G) A
forget me mother
life’s too hard to be understood
off your wicked ways
is too simple to explain
