.
what is the system 
that goes on under the surface
feeling concerned 
always about something
.
in peace
degeneration gets us backwards

we are giving each others back
for the best part 
of drug addiction is 
ending up a Christian

.
she was in my dream,
grabbed me by the shoulder 
and said, 
looking at my eyes intensely
"at that time, 
in only thought 
i was violating 
a rule"
and was speaking the truth
.
we went out of this shop
demons came out 
from all corners
and i was disposed 
to do just that
being really straight in my hits
.
kill 
with a look of power
some 
know each other
.
i went on
they convinced me to shut up
they resist and resist 
until finally they cannot 
hold it no more
when the system is of god
later in life 
flow
of the holy spirit
.
all those years 
this angels 
trapped inside my head, 
just because 
i didnt know them 
and i knew 
instead
the self proclaimed 
antichrist 
.
he displays his wings 
in an performance of power, 
wanting admiration, 
craving for worship
feeling concerned
always about something
.
death 
was so probable 
that somehow 
it ceased 
to be a threat
.
back to the surface
in classroom
the wages of sin
are death and damnation
the circulization 
of the video
centralize 
and manage changes
.
i remember a few kills 
.
with his tummy 
on the floor, 
face and beard 
to the camera 
he explained
"do not fear 
what the things of the world 
can do to the body"
how that made him 
an invincible fighter 
and warrior
.
but what's the system 
that goes on under the surface
there is a satisfaction in typing, 
period
