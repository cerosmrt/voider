With the map ready on my phone, I jumped in the car I just bought and headed up the hills my dick
                                       .                                        
The morning summer breeze felt cold coming through the open windows of this tiny car, but once I got high enough that new sun started hitting my skin and made it warm
                                       .                                        
The sun was shining so bright that you could tell that it was going to be a hot day
                                       .                                        
    I felt so much at peace that I couldn't allow myself to drive any faster    
                                       .                                        
                  Though I was excited I was going to see her                   
                                       .                                        
                   The closer I got the stronger the tension                    
                                       .                                        
                     I hadn't seen her in such a long time                      
                                       .                                        
                  My heart beat strong and my legs were shaky                   
                                       .                                        
It was as if an invisible barrier was being forced to bend and allow me get in as I pushed through
                                       .                                        
     Our attraction fields clashing with each other before they would merge     
                                       .                                        
              Dreams I had while I was away were coming back to me              
                                       .                                        
                             I tried not to engage                              
                                       .                                        
         Just the memory of those dreams made me want to relieve myself         
                                       .                                        
There was no one to be found anywhere near the route and the thought of making a quick stop on the side crossed my mind
                                       .                                        
                         I had to fight the temptation                          
                                       .                                        
      Soon the wind blew on my face and the smell of roses brought me back      
                                       .                                        
I started crossing the top of this hill, and when I reached it, from up here I could see this big lake down in the valley and two big mountains that made the one I was crossing very small in comparison
                                       .                                        
      I drove down this hill with my sight fixed on the intimidating view       
                                       .                                        
        It was so mesmerizing that I soon got lost in my thoughts again         
                                       .                                        
              So long I had been waiting for this moment to arrive              
                                       .                                        
                            It was finally happening                            
                                       .                                        
        I couldn't stop my mind from racing and evoking all these images        
                                       .                                        
                          The things I would do to her                          
                                       .                                        
      Unfolded before me, all the possibilities of what was about to come       
                                       .                                        
                         The things she would do to me                          
                                       .                                        
I had tried not to think about it, all the way since I left home to catch that aeroplane
                                       .                                        
       But now, the more I fought and resisted, the worst it was getting        
                                       .                                        
                     The thought of seeing each other again                     
                                       .                                        
  I wished she would suck me dry right here and now, just the way she used to   
                                       .                                        
                          "Breathe", I reminded myself                          
                                       .                                        
            I took a deep breath, and the wind suddenly hit my face             
                                       .                                        
                The stunning view would put my thoughts on hold                 
                                       .                                        
                             I was back on the road                             
                                       .                                        
                       This place was so pretty and still                       
                                       .                                        
                                   So virgin                                    
                                       .                                        
                        No house at sight, nothing built                        
                                       .                                        
                                   Not a soul                                   
                                       .                                        
               There was something                                              
            so deeply connecting about being disconnected from everyone else    
                                       .                                        
                 Everything about it seemed pure and harmonious                 
                                       .                                        
      This type of serenity could only be felt in a life outside the city       
                                       .                                        
                    I found myself smiling with my teeth out                    
                                       .                                        
                           It could not be described                            
                                       .                                        
             There couldn't be a more perfect place for our reunion             
                                       .                                        
          The idea of being with her in a place so remote was exciting          
                                       .                                        
                               Just the two of us                               
                                       .                                        
                 Just the immensity of the land surrounding us                  
                                       .                                        
                                It was too much                                 
                                       .                                        
                             A vivid vision emerged                             
                                       .                                        
I was sitting on the ground, with my back against a tree, and she was sitting next to me, relaxing under the shade
                                       .                                        
I was on my phone, showing her pictures of the place I had come from and had called home for the past two years
                                       .                                        
          She was watching interested, but then she moved closer to me          
                                       .                                        
               She lay on the floor, resting her head on my thigh               
                                       .                                        
                         I immediately felt the tension                         
                                       .                                        
She was staring at the leaves, and the sunlight filtered through them casted spotted shadows on her face
                                       .                                        
                              I put my phone away                               
                                       .                                        
                   She turned to her side and closed her eyes                   
                                       .                                        
       She moved her hair away revealing her neck in a silent invitation        
                                       .                                        
             I gently placed my hand on her head, holding her neck              
                                       .                                        
I started playing softly with my fingers in the root of her hair, making her shiver and relax
                                       .                                        
              Her lips parted slightly when her jaw dropped a bit               
                                       .                                        
Her cool hand, delicately drawing lazy circles on my thigh sent a shiver down my spine
                                       .                                        
                  I was hypersensitive to the slightest touch                   
                                       .                                        
My heart started pounding, pumping blood so intensely that a pressure started growing between my legs
                                       .                                        
My shorts got much tighter than they already were and the contour now showing was obvious
                                       .                                        
She still had her eyes closed and I feared it would keep growing enough to touch her and wake her from her trancelike state
                                       .                                        
Her face was so close that I could feel the warmth with each breath, that was slow and even
                                       .                                        
        Her lips could have kissed it if she only stretched them enough         
                                       .                                        
                              I couldn’t look away                              
                                       .                                        
                    I wanted to put it in her mouth so badly                    
                                       .                                        
  Suddenly a leaf fell from the tree and onto her face and she opened her eyes  
                                       .                                        
            The look in her eyes told me everything I needed to know            
                                       .                                        
She then held eye contact with me with intensely for a moment, and then looked back down, as if considering something
                                       .                                        
                       I held my breath, in anticipation                        
                                       .                                        
                             She was going to do it                             
                                       .                                        
I barely pushed her head towards me when she suddenly leant in, embracing the bulge in my shorts with her open mouth
                                       .                                        
                  A rush of adrenaline coursed through my body                  
                                       .                                        
                The warmth of her mouth made me pump even harder                
                                       .                                        
                            I couldn't wait anymore                             
                                       .                                        
                 I reached down my shorts and took my dick out                  
                                       .                                        
       She wasn't expecting it from springing, and a reflex made her move       
                                       .                                        
I squeeze it tight with my hand and teased her with it, moving it back and forth
                                       .                                        
                She bit her bottom lip and I took that as a sign                
                                       .                                        
                   I pulled her towards me with my other hand                   
                                       .                                        
           A big kiss with her open mouth covered the head of my dick           
                                       .                                        
I could feel the texture of her tongue, playfuly moving around it and licking it like a lollipop
                                       .                                        
         She then sucked so hard I felt cum was being extracted from me         
                                       .                                        
                She then abruptly drew her face all the way down                
                                       .                                        
                         She covered my dick completely                         
                                       .                                        
          I could feel the warmth and moist and softness of her mouth           
                                       .                                        
                         "This is it", I said to myself                         
                                       .                                        
                        I thought I was going to explode                        
                                       .                                        
She slowly moved up wrapping my dick with her lips with such pressure I could feel exactly where she was at
                                       .                                        
She gradually went all the way up and with a long last lick, took it out of her mouth
                                       .                                        
My dick was now fully uncoverd, and I could see it shining with the moisture of her saliva
                                       .                                        
When she looked up to see my reaction, I could see a string of precum still attached to her mouth
                                       .                                        
                             It made me crave more                              
                                       .                                        
                  I held the back of her head with both hands                   
                                       .                                        
            I pulled her back down to make her have another go at it            
                                       .                                        
                                She devoured it                                 
                                       .                                        
         She pushed herself so far I could feel the back of her throat          
                                       .                                        
                          She held her position there                           
                                       .                                        
                             My whole body flinched                             
                                       .                                        
                             My balls were tingling                             
                                       .                                        
                               I was going to cum                               
                                       .                                        
                      My body still remembers that feeling                      
                                       .                                        
        I looked down and noticed the erection showing through my shorts        
                                       .                                        
                They were the same shorts I was using back then                 
                                       .                                        
                     I looked at the map, and I was not far                     
                                       .                                        
          Once up the next hill I would see the house in the distance           
                                       .                                        
                           I would be there very soon                           
                                       .                                        
                          I couldn't wait to show her                           
                                       .                                        
                I knew she'd want to remember what it felt like                 
                                       .                                        
             And that she wouldn't mind welcoming me hard like this             
                                       .                                        
                                    #MORNING                                    
                                       .                                        
The next morning, the sun filtered through the villa's rustic windows, a warm glow on our intertwined bodies
                                       .                                        
                  She slipped out of bed and into the kitchen                   
                                       .                                        
                         The aroma of coffee woke me up                         
                                       .                                        
      I was by myself in the bed                                                
                                                  so I decided to get up        
                                       .                                        
      I walked over and I saw her                                               
   She was facing away, unaware that I was standing by the door, looking at her 
                                       .                                        
She was too busy making a simple breakfast of fresh fruits, toasted bread, and coffee
                               She was looking radiant in the morning light     
                                       .                                        
I decided to surprise her, so I quietly approached her from behind, grabbed her by the waist and kissed her behind the ear
                                       .                                        
    As she turned around, she smiled at me and I pressed her against my body    
                                       .                                        
She put a headphone in my ear and we finished listening to that song without saying a word, while she finished dishing the breakfast
                                       .                                        
    "I was going to surprise you in bed with it"                                
                              "Maybe we can have it in the gallery outside"     
                                       .                                        
           "What do you say if we go outside to have this breakfast”            
                                       .                                        
we sat down in the porch with a view of the meadows all around us, relaxed with the cold breeze
                                       .                                        
                     we decided to explore the countryside,                     
                                       .                                        
       Without saying a word                                                    
              we started walking through the wildflower meadows,                
                                  hand in hand                                  
                            enjoying the simplicity of each other’s company     
                                       .                                        
                                    #EVENING                                    
                                       .                                        
we laid on the grass next to each other and contemplated the warm light coming down
                                       .                                        
      I looked at her and she was                                               
                              lost in her thoughts                              
            suddenly she started speaking and I got lost in them too            
                      I listened, without worrying about having to talk back    
                                       .                                        
    We knew our time on this world was limited,                                 
                     we chose to make every second count,                       
knowing that only cherishing the precious experience of the moment would create memories that would last even long after we had to part, our ghosts dancing for all eternity
                                       .                                        
      We watched the sun set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink       
                                       .                                        
    then night fell and the breeze got colder and so                            
                        we retreated to our cosy villa,                         
                     and I decided to ignite the fireplace                      
                 we had enough wood for all these chilli nights                 
I considered ourselves so lucky to have plenty of firewood for this cold nights 
                                       .                                        
                                     #FIRE                                      
                                       .                                        
                         and we got lost in each other                          
                                       .                                        
This time, it was slower, more intimate, as we cherished every touch, every kiss, and every whispered word
                                       .                                        
       while I held her breasts                                                 
                                 "I love them"                                  
                            I thought, but I seemed to have said it outloud     
                                       .                                        
                       I stripped her from all coverings                        
                                       .                                        
     and I gently pushed her face away                                          
                 the warmth of her breath lingering on my skin                  
                                                                                
                               and in a quick rotation I circled her waiste     
                                       .                                        
  I had her kneeling down with her elbows in the couch holding her              
              I aimed to go inside her, and she was waiting for it              
                    I was about to do it but by my surprise                     
     the press of her body against me sent a delicious shiver down my spine     
                and I surrendered to the pleasure of experience                 
from then on I grabbed her by her arms in a desperate attempt from keeping her from moving that much 
but now she had no way of holding herself and went face and chest first on the couch
                            I went out and back in                              
pushing as deep as I could and making sure that I as well pushed her all the way with my hips against the back of her legs and ass
    that bounced with every pump and would make the view only so much nicer     
                 I was savouring every slam of this interaction                 
                   Her every reaction amplified the pleasure                    
                       I could feel her wet and dripping                        
                              from the inside out                               
                      there was no way she could fake that                      
                        the way her pussy held me tight                         
                          we had complementary bodies                           
              as I went to push deeper and deeper with every pump               
                            she was enjoying it too                             
  with the sounds she was making I could paint the world white any moment now   
              I grabbed her by the waist, just like in the morning              
                           and she let her arms fall                            
and now I started pulling her against me instead, over and over and over and over
                                       .                                        
         The delights of smoking on this serene moment came to my mind          
                                       .                                        
there was no moment that reflected the essence of tranquillity and the peace of the soul as much as this one
                                       .                                        
But then I looked at her laying on my chest with her eyes closed and I realised again I didn't need one
                                          I was glad I quit because of her      
                                       .                                        
    My lungs were now cleaner and so was my heart                               
                     Staring at the fire I drifted away and soon fell asleep    
                                       .                                        
    We spent the night wrapped in each other's arms                             
                                  the fire witnessing our rekindled passion     
                                       .                                        
     All tension had resolved on that release                                   
                                        If I dreamt, I don't remember what      
                                       .                                        
As we drifted off to sleep, we knew this reunion had rekindled something deep and enduring between us, something that would sustain us until we met again
                                       .                                        
I woke up once during the night, and seeing her sleep peacefully, made me feel a sense of contentment I hadn’t felt in months
                                       .

                                       .                                        
                         In the infinite possibilities                          
                                       .                                        
     an experience I could not put into words                                   
                                                      it was unspeakable        
                                       .                                        
                         last time courage was missing                          
                                       .                                        
                                   I told her                                   
                                       .                                        
                                want to change?                                 
                                       .                                        
      this time she got behind me                                               
                                         and put her hands under my shorts      
                                       .                                        
                   Day after day, dreams bled into my reality                   
                                       .                                        
                               we created our own                               
                                       .                                        
                            shake out of your dreams                            
                                       .                                        
I was trying to be consistent with my pumps/thrusts, but each one felt like it could be the last
                                       .                                        
   she was the last thing I saw before I fell asleep                            
                                                 the scream became a yawn       
                                       .                                        
                     it is the one who dared the one loved                      
                                       .                                        
I regretted having to find the time to do the things that you don't want but must be done
                                       .                                        
               If we don't see life it is as if it didn't happen                
                                       .                                        
     You want to go out, save the world                                         
                            But you get heartbroken                             
                             The world is too big                               
                                                          every growing         
                                       .                                        
                             Why did you leave me?                              
                                       .                                        
                                    My self                                     
                                       .                                        
                             She's much better now                              
                                       .                                        
    She forgave me because she knew I loved her                                 
                                      She just sometimes needed a reminder      
                                       .                                        
             Loving the memory of all the things that interested me             
                                       .                                        
       this time around                                                         
                                        I wanted to teach her a few things

                       I told her about the problem I had                       
                                       .                                        
   "Whatever it is, I'll address it", she said confidently                      
                                     I don't know if she knew what I meant

   She wanted know what the problem was, and I tried to dismiss it as a joke

            She insisted, so I made her look with a hint in my eyes             
                                       .                                        
              She looked down, but still didn't seem to understand              
                                       .

Soñé con Cande. Mi cara se acercaba a la suya y no pude evitar besarla. El momento en que nuestros labios se tocaron, pareció gustarle y entró en el mismo viaje que yo, me devolvía los besos. No recuerdo antes y después. Lo "raro" es que no percibo a ella como la percibí en sueños. Pero si es cierto que alguna vez la vi así. And seeing is believing. And believing is timeless.
