someone as useless as him with an orientation toward being a student who liked to sit and contemplate ideas, talk in cafes, and smoke cigars and drink could never make anything easier for anyone than everyone was already trying to make. So he thought his task would be to make things more difficult for people because there would come a time when what people wanted was not more ease but more challenge and difficulty. That is really smart — and it is witty and it is true

dijo que tenía calor y le ayude a sacarse el pullover pero en el intento el corpiño se le levanto y sus pechos se dejaron ver y eran hermosos y grandes y llenos y le gustó que los vea y los rozara con mis manos pero me dio vergüenza que había alguien más también al lado
después ella se acostó arriba mío en cruz y boca abajo y yo levanté su pollera por atrás y sentí sus gluteos y se dejó ver su bombacha blanca y por detrás de veían marcados sus labios

Yossarian: “You mean there’s a catch?”
“Sure there’s a catch,” Doc Daneeka replied. “Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn’t really crazy.”
There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one’s own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn’t, but if he was sane, he had to fly them. If he flew them, he was crazy and didn’t have to; but if he didn’t want to, he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.
“That’s some catch, that Catch-22,” he observed.
“It’s the best there is,” Doc Daneeka agreed.”

we were going to go to the country after lunch at my grandmas, but i thought maybe i'd stay another few hours with him before leaving
outside of my grandmas there was this argument with my mother about the rest of the empanadas, we could have taken then for the night but my mother says no
"if you want when we go back i can tell you my theory" i said to him while we walked home. he said he wouldn't reveal a thing

faca was there and i was going to get him for cigarettes because my father's companion wanted them and he ran out
when i was walking downhill i could see all this houses really apart from one another and surrounded by cars parked. there was one up in the hill, another further down. i wasnt going to any of those but further away
it was woodland and sand on the floor

i said goodbye to my grandma when they stood up to go eating. i have her a hug and a kiss and i gave her jose"s phone for her to give it back. i went out running through the door
as soon as i left i saw the duvet on the floor where i left it
i considered leaving it there but imagining my grandma having to pick it up and put it back for me was enough for me to go back
"this is the moment when i willingly walk back to danger" i thought, nevertheless i open the door and went straight to the room
to the left there they were, making the table for dinner
just turning right i could enter the room on the hallway. covering half of its entrance, a sheet that hanged from the roof that wouldn't let me see my grandma's room. i went in, and by this time the duvet was a unknotted braid of long brown hair. lo enrolle y lo puse en la cama del medio. there were more beds to the left, all dark and cold. didn't see the one on the right
no ghost was there
i went back and tried to take tic tacs from the kiosk after taking a while to decide. i knew i was going to pay for it

me fui a la habitación a preparar la cama para dormir
estaba oscura y había una lata de cerveza vacía que creí podría haber dejado Facu
y queriendo decir "host" (guest) seguía diciendo hostage
hostage
mientras estaba ahí creí mi abuela dormía en la otra habitación
Las luces apagadas y 
yo buscaba sin éxito prender la luz de mi celular
primero lo desbloqueaba y no largaba luz
después prendo la linterna, dos veces y nada
todo mientras caminaba hacia afuera de la habitación, sin conseguir hacer la cama
ahí vi que había una pequeña luz amarilla en el baño del living (no del pasillo) y ahí me metí
conseguí prender la luz de mí celular y salí al living pero automáticamente las luces habían vuelto
me senté en el sillón de la abuela y comencé a oír voces, que a momentos creí que me hablaban a mí
"fuera! fuera de mi casa!" le escuchaba decir a la voz de mí abuela enojada una vez me había sentado en su sillón, aún sabiendo que mí abuela no estaba ahí. Eran fantasmas que en sueños parecía ser normal escuchar más no ver
"más poderoso es Jesucristo" pensé, y me saco el miedo. 
entendí que no necesitaba más poder que ese
y entonces este hombre con sombrero empezó a salir. Cuando estaba ya en el marco de la puerta me pare y le pregunté
Quien sos vos?
le pregunté
y el estaba frenado en el marco de la puerta esperándome, mostrando solo la mitad de su cara
"quien sos vos hijo de puta" me dijo, "alguien que no se fía de vos"
parecía mí abuelo de joven con un sombrero (al momento solo era un hombre de sombrero yendose)

se sentó al lado mío y me dijo que quería era le rompa las tarjetas de crédito porque María Amelia lo había engañado cuando de boar hunting

in my dream i took acid
slept right afterwards and then went to bed
i was coming downstairs when i heard the resortes under the mattress make noise
i went back upstairs and slowly tried to uncover the matress that was folded inside
slowly, the body of my sister started uncovering
and she woke up
and rose
and asked me if i wanted to go to bed
and i told her no
and then went downstairs
and the acid kept going
i started dancing
and my perception got distorted
i saw the living couch and my guitar right next to it
and i stop dancing
and perception got fixed
and i started dancing again, and again the same thing
i noticed, like a guy previously said
that the effects are still there, coming and going, whether i notice or not
i took the guitar and went outside
and the guitar had just been repaired by my sister
and i started playing it
and it sounded awful but so cool
it was the other way around, thinner to thicker strings 
and it sounded like a famous song played in the air, but when made chords, sounded like barks from hell, like a monster shouting
and i tried it a few more times, and the more brutal it got
then i was at this festival, regretting having drank after taking that acid
and i saw the drummer, and a band was playing
the presenter was pouring himself some whiskey and talking to the crowd
then the band got down and the presenter was emptying the whiskey bottle and wanted the lady that came down from stage to draw this idea he came up with of 
a man splashing shit on everything that was written, with the image of this pants down splashing shit onto this book that seemed sacred
what was edgier and more antichristian
the idea was the Jesus didn't write and asked people not to write and based on what others wrote of him we have the organised religion we have now
by disobeying him we honour him
zore then said to me that the lady thought that he (the presenter) was lame
a very different idea from what he thought of himself
he thought he was being cool but was broken and everyone could see it
then we were with zore and euge mirando una pizarra en la pared con algunos papeles, entre ellos este dibujo, y partes de una investigación para diseñar esta idea "cool"  y hablamos de Jesús. 
"Como socrates, no escribía. No es que no supiera escribir, elegía no hacerlo"
y el zore dijo
"los escribas unos maestros... como escribían"
"siii", dije

we were in the room waiting for food
i heard my father's voice so i pointed it out to violet and don't know who else was with my but with no chance of making myself understand in Spanish
they (group of people outside glass) turned around and looked at us
one big black man was the first i saw turn
then the big white man i saw first with the voice of my father slowly started looking more and more like my father
i didn't suspect a thing
so i was going outside running with a smile on my face just to explain the situation that i thought was a good reminder of home
but when i open the door my whole family was getting in through the door
mother
father
sister
my grandma had come in first but didn't find me
when i open the door she hugged my neck from behind and i hugged her
she had been there trying to find me first, then stood by the door until i can't
then I gave a big hug to my father
i told him i didn't expect them
that i only heard his voice and went to say it to this stranger man
i was so happy almost to the point of tears
it was a surprise visit for me and i never suspected even when my father was speaking outside 
 (even though when i notice it was them i wasnt as surprised because they had been with my sister somewhere else in europe)
i felt so loved and supported
I've missed them so much
the only one i didnt get to hug was my sister, i carassed her arm later on in a demonstration of love 
then it seemed like we were one a terminal
"instead of waking up to Disney you now can wake up to this" margarita said, that now she was also part of the family pack
then i was laying down facing down, and later turned up
i looked up laying down on my side and my sister was there being my pillow with two rounded pieces of cheese and two rounded pickes above in her eyes
i laughed at her and one of the cheeses feel off
she got worried that i was laughing at her for being topless
i said nothing like that, i was fine with it and not even looking
i let her know and she laughed finding it funny as well
once i turned my face back down there it was my mother's face with her black hairs, 
her head looked bigger
she closed her eyes as soon as i turned to see her
then she looked up
she wasn't going to talk to me or do eye contact
i was looking at her eyes
observing them even they weren't looking at me
i saw the mum i once loved
i held her hand and almost cried
i woke up

computing is not separable from religion
.
computer was a space of spiritual contemplation, a temple
.
The computer was a device for structuring the spirit, consulting with and making offerings to God, and living as God instructed
.
"I made God’s temple and now I’m waiting for something to happen."
.
 learning to purify himself and respect the purity of the world around him
.
The Divine Plan does not rely on its agents being perfect or knowing the true significance of their work

TempleOS may not directly bring about the new spiritual order, but it will inspire the system that does
.
Your religion says you must live a certain way. It tells you what is valuable and what is disgusting

structures your information environment and cognition on a very practical level
.
your religion is the fundamental information fabric, the soul, of your society

when writing came, the sacred written word and the compiled bible of sacred history became the new cognitive foundation, the new information system, and the new religion

when the novel, pamphlet, and newspaper gave partial way to the radio broadcast and television show, the soul of this nascent managed experience regime was only strengthened

.
Without agency over the world in which we live, people cannot develop the forward-looking spirit that is necessary for growth and life

Ingenious ideas are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks

the cave dwellers
.
In a land where kids only shoot videogame guns, this hunter was about to show them one shot from the sewers. Then they saw it, behind a cage that seems like an ant aquarium. A white and black cougar between all these black bears/wolves. He's heading further into the cave and they are going to devouring him. Then the cougar became a dog, a dalmata, fighting off these hienas that slowly get closer and closer. In the end of the cage stands this guy with a lighter in hand, trying to save the dog after he "by mistake" let him in to begin with. I went on a tirolesa and tried and kick his head. Then the cuidador came running hiting and sending away this guy for putting the dog at risk. 
"this Imperial thing" pointing at the lighter that was handed to him, had a little crown on top. He was excusing himself for putting the cougar in danger. He says to camera that he "didn't understand this thing"

just now, in a series of traps, one with an arrow shooting straight to teh floor if you go through the wrong door, another one where a guillotine fell over my left hip, and it didnt cut me in half but i felt the shooting pain, and i commented this to JT that was in front of me inthis series of tests. Behind me a teacher came over and i told her too.
Before I was in the back seet of barriolas car and i was staring at the window, on the far side there was this kid, and right next to me a pile with magazines of playstation games
when the car started again there was a pile of playstation boxes
the kid on the other side was looking at me so i didnt dare taking a magazine i was going to read, but in my mind i did and when i place it over it didnt fell in the exact same position but this time fell on top of the others
"i dont know why i sit here" i said
"si, no se por que te sentaste porque quisiste nomas"


from the window i could see this man as well, putting gas in his motorbike
he had like a pocket for his balls 
so his penis was huge
.
at some point i thought of rob making his good  old comments about me and the way i was at work
i remember messugah, me telling me about this video I found about them in the 90s and how underground they were, only a few people seemed to know there songs or who they where, but they were crazy heavy

there were this two petite girls into me, one blonde () the other one brown hair (remindedmeofCamDran)

after a series of tests, we climbed with brownhair

on top we arrived to this platforms from where the boatswhere going to depart

In the ancient city of Athens, nestled among the philosophers and thinkers of classical Greece, there lived a curious and ambitious young philosopher named Callias. Callias was known for his insatiable curiosity and a desire to uncover the mysteries of the universe. One day, as he perused the bustling markets of Athens, he stumbled upon a peculiar stall tucked away in a corner.


The old vendor, with a mysterious twinkle in his eye, beckoned Callias over to a small, dusty jar. Inside the jar was a swirling mist, and as the vendor explained, it contained an ancient and cursed burp that had been trapped for centuries.


Legend had it that the burp belonged to the great philosopher Aristophanes, who, in a moment of levity during one of his famous symposiums, had burped loudly, unintentionally invoking the wrath of a mischievous deity. The burp, it was said, carried within it the essence of humor and chaos.


Intrigued by the tale and sensing an opportunity to unlock the secrets of comedy, Callias purchased the jar from the old vendor. Little did he know that this seemingly innocent acquisition would set off a series of comical and absurd events.


As soon as Callias brought the jar back to his study, he decided to release the ancient burp. To his surprise, as the jar opened, the burp manifested as a mischievous spirit with a penchant for playing tricks. The spirit, now free after centuries of confinement, accompanied Callias on his philosophical endeavors.


The cursed burp, possessing a knowledge of humor and wit, offered Callias unconventional insights into philosophy. As the duo roamed the streets of Athens, the burp pranked unsuspecting passersby, turning the serious into the absurd.


Callias, torn between the pursuit of serious philosophy and the chaotic influence of the burp, found himself at the center of a philosophical revolution. The citizens of Athens, initially puzzled, began to embrace the unusual teachings of Callias and his mystical companion.


In the end, Callias learned that wisdom and humor need not be mutually exclusive. The ancient cursed burp, though mischievous, brought a new perspective to philosophy, encouraging people to find joy in the absurdity of life.


And so, the legend of Callias and the ancient cursed burp became a whimsical tale passed down through the ages, reminding us that even in the pursuit of wisdom, a good laugh is sometimes the best companion

había unos sándwiches, unas salchichas y no se que más
vino un chabón y se me puso a la derecha
en cuanto vino la mujer pregunto que queríamos y el loco se adelantó y pidió una cerveza
la mujer me entonces la espalda 
"o para, vos estabas antes" me dijo
"no hay problema" le dije
yo había estado intentado espaciarme de un grupo de pendejos que habían llegado y se me pusieron atrás e invadían mí espacio, lo sentía en mi espalda, la forma en que me arrinconaban contra la barra
cuando la mujer volvió, sin antes haber servido la pinta, me miró
"un café?"
"no ahora no se puede porque le cambié el filtro (para servir la birra). si me hubieses dicho antes..."
yo miré la góndola una vez más, me agache para ver la parte de abajo
y me fui saliendo del tumulto para atrás
parecía haber estado juntando algo, cuando me paré
y la vi
anto
la saludé y no reaccionó, seguia con la mirada al frente
yo la miraba y muchos recuerdos de me venían a la cabeza
sentimientos del pasado
la miraba
la salude una vez más 
y está vez
se giró y me sonrió
dándome la bienvenida
pero sin atinar a abrazarme o besarme
sin acercarse un centímetro
"anto!"
"hola chucho!"
...
"cómo estás? le pregunté
"al borde de una depresión" dijo
parecía que iba a llorar
"te querés sentar"? le pregunté
empezó a caminar y se acercó a la barra, donde solo el último banco a la derecha estaba libre
estaba a punto de sentarse al lado de esta chica
"no querés ir a la mesa?"
y le señalé la mesa donde abajo tirada estaba mi mochila
y ahí fuimos, yo con mis manos cargadas de semillas de girasol
she sat in the corner and i in front of her
"i'd offer you coffee but the woman didn't want to serve me"... 
le dije mientras me sentaba
"maybe in a little bit me vende"
i sat down and spilled all the sunflower seeds i had in my hands over the table, but some went through the spaces between the woods and fell onto the floor
then anto was standing behind me
i turned over to see her from my chair, behind her the door that went back to the bar
"I'm worried" she said
"can it be fixed?"
"i guess"
"nothing to worry too much about" i said
"... it's just comments"
that made me wonder about her husband and the child they had together
"is it just rumours?" i asked
"yeah"
"try not to pay too much attention to it" 
her smile didn't seem to convincing
Lo dije mientras se iba al baño, ahora la mesa siendo la única afuera
me estaba armando un porrobyv pensando en Damon albarnb the something day song and wondering how much of a genius he was just to instantly convince myself that he was because of that melody
estaba midiendo mis movidas para del papel en el que había juntado mis sunflowers seeds cargar un poco de polvillo de porro y ponerlo en la punta para darme un shot
las piezas que consegui poner al final eran pedazos de milanesas "(corteza) que volví a tirar al suelo de dónde lo había juntado
en el piso había encontrado un encendedor y todo
-
y miraba hacia la puerta intentando medir si el humo iba a delatarme yendo hacia adentro cuando lo prendiera
-
"mi papá no sabe pero mí mamá esta saliendo su papá, el abuelo de..."
-
supe que me estaba hablando de marianto
pensé en la hija que tenían juntos y espere que no se la haya mandado

sultana was in my dream, grabbed me by the shoulder and said, looking at my eyes intensely:
(you need help?....) you can tell me.
i nodded, then she headed out when this two workers, one really fat and eating a big bag of cheetos, came into the room. I was looking at a computer screen trying to show her the software i made (at least the last version of it i made through chatGPT) and i cuuldnt find the folder. 
Then i was at the beach, all my family included.
An my sister and many other women started singing a really stupid and proud song about being vulgar and antifeminine, something totally uncalled for in that context. They were crying for attention.
after theirr number they starting dismantling, idont know if just tthem or the entire beach, and lastly staid this reallly big guitar, really beautiful and authentiic, electric, and i started playing a few strings one by one and moving the knobs to see if it worked the amp it was plugged into
it started sounding really distorted sound and then a guy came and grabbed the guitar before me and started playing himself
he asked me if the gutiar was mine
i pointed at my sister that was a few steps behind, really proud of her and thinking i was going to record with it at some point
i really fell in love with that guitar, ive never seen nothing like it
the case was much biggr, i dont know about the strings and knobs
.


Ive done absolutely nothing
he said crying while they locked him away
.
you study story aas a victim but mainly as a perpetrator
i was pursuing a fat marilyn manson with everything i could think of, while he was running, screaming, vomiting and falling 
i threw a sharp knife to him, that i just had colelcted, then i started throwing shoes at him, failing in every ocassion
then i picked up a burned trunk (tronco) i found on the grass of this beachlikeplace
he was reaching a multitude, but i was certain and confident that i would catch him
before, this two guys were speaking one next to each other and i pointed to guy next to the son of a bitch and the son of a bitcch knodded, telling me to proceed in hurting his "friend"
i went ahead and kicked him in the knee instead, with the full force of my left heel, even t\hough in the dream it was not at all easy, i needed to to such an effort
after i got rid of him was that manson came running to assist, but when he looked at me he started running in the other direction
in the moment he appeared, i through (i dont know if a knife or a shoe) and at the same time from a cliff a car came jumping, and turning sideways as it fell in slowmotion, in the most spectacular way
what i threw and what the car threw where in sync at the time of falling
before all of this i was in the body of woman, gonig into this basement of this hospital, seeing locked inside all this children that wanted to go home
asking for their parents
i as the woman said that i was going to call their parents and tell them about the situation, that in no way they'd be aware of the conditions in which this scientist had them
it was a species of mental or behavioural institution, but the kids were really young, dressing only their underwear and a tshirt, and some of them (if not all) with their head shaved
i went on and got out of that room and back to the surface, saying "at that time, in only thought i was violating a rule" and i was disposed to do that
after this dark room with this giant iron door that regardless was open (in the moment of that scene coming to me)
i think after passing thrrough this surgery scene a doctor stopped me in front of me, but instead of running like a prey i kept like a predator
.
all those years this angels trapped inside my head, just because i didnt know them and i knew the self proclaimed antichrist instead
they are free, return to god

sultana was again in my dream
she invited me to go acompany her into going ottown and rleasing cv
i dreamt about the devils card, that came inverted three times
in the dream it meant that the goddess was telling me you still have time to kill baphometh
in some cards it was like the ten of wands and it was this man with chivo head
in another one it said devils
but the card was always inverted
and three times appeared
and the voice in my head or sultana told me that it meant, at least antanio rhar "you still have time to kill baphometh"
when i was cooking the eggs it was this really weird industrial kitchen, half disarmed, and my computer was on top
i was about to throw the eggs into the pan, and one fell and start cooking, th eother one fell and sizzled until it just fell to the floor
sultana came back alll ready to go find a job, looking nice all dressed up and with sunglasses of a red/warm brown color
she was waiting for me and i said i was going tot pack my food and come with her but instead i started throwing the eggs in the pan
before when she asked me if i wanted to come, behind her came an aniaml, i dont know if it was a chicken or i think a small mammal, but right now i dont rememberr
when i pulled the card, once it was in a pan
the time before, the girls asked me, i think there it was amy from aptl and they knew somehow i knew how to read tarot so i went and pulled from an oven the first card from a pile (that supposedly was there for people to pick the top one,, already shuffled in random order and placed there) and it was this ten of wands with this man standing and a carnero head
"you still have time to kill baphometh" is what the goddess meant to say when every time this card was presented invertedd three times to someone
that was in the past, in the mythological realm, but now i was embodying it
the goddess (keisha) said to me:
you still have time to kill baphometh

we were watching this movie documentary about this guy that has been abused since the age of one
lying on the floor
this guy explained to the camera with his tummy on the floor, face and beard facingi the camera, how that made him an invincible fighter and warrior later in life
and later or sooner there was this kid, around for, and his brother, and it was the same peron  than before: "i was looking at the colors, too young for someone being behind me"
the other kid also joked around it
the main looked like the son of jim carry in liar liar 
we were watching this movie, and after this guy was speaking and said that information, i tried to go back with the remote to seee that part again,b ecause it seemed that something i had missed
the kids were in a hill, outside, laughing even about that, enjoying their lives
but they were adults (at least wise as adults) in kids bodies
they were not resentful about what happened to them
after going backawrds in the movie i never got to see the same dialogue as before, it was always something different
so in the end i think we kept watching
with me it was JCamp and VVeig
then v (if it rreally was her) said yea al shore the sister when he was one gave him 
" a wank?" i asked, thinking she was about to tell me another story of abuse
"no, hes coming" or "hes on the way"
"ah, good" i said
we were waiting for him
but then it was me and all shore in that dream, the sun was out and the skie was blue and around our waists we had this towels and we were about to go for a run around this terrain
first i was completely naked and my friend was completely dressed and i was jogging behind him and double kicking his asscheeks with doublekicks
jumping and kicking left, thenn right, in left cheek then right cheek respectively
then we both started jogging, this time both of was were with this towel around our waists and running, the other guy saiid something so motivating that i cheered him up
there was this wall in this terrain and space  for like a car in both ends, so we were about to to many times the same loop
i remember the ice project (in the dreamm i dont know how i called it, if ice man or similar) because the guy did this short loop in antarrtic to be able to run a marathon
a small insert of an explanation came in the dream saying, one of his team guys, surounded by the rest in a documentary kind of way, that they did this diginig in the snow so they could make hearing more clear, "and it worked" he said
like they couldnt waste even air
they needed to be able to speak during storms and such, win over the wind
so we started the infinite loops with me friend, even though in the dream we only did half a lap and in the entrance one car came out, surrounded also by towels,  covered by them

rebekahwastryingtosuckmydickwhenvioletasgone
we layed outside on the ground and she layed on the floor tummy first with her mouth too close to my crotch, staring at it waiting for my to take it out
i was sitting down right next to her
previously i had kissed her
and i thought of my girlfriend but i was so horny and she was so hot
i put it in the back of my head and went on to do it, but for some reason we stopped (it was her birthday) and  i went to ahve a shower to be cleaner
i remember having that thought when we were sitting down, that i hadnt showered
if i had i would have probably let all happen
andn probably it would have, i just didnt let it because of my resistance, of that feeling of dirty
after shower thoguh, i was home, and my father was there
and i was really happy to see him
and i was ready to do something with him and my mother, even though she was not in the room
"we are leaving" he said
they were heading for work, and i had just got there to see them after a long time
so i was sad
i was aboutt o shower when that happened
I was going to shower in my fathers room, as if there was a shower in the corner
earlier i went to meet my worst enemy, rebossio, and i shook his hand
he was a black young man
he told me how his brother tried to punch him, and he dodged, and then smacked him, even stabbed, i dont remember
and at first he evaded my hand, then he went for it, with an old school shake
old cool shake, no variation 1 but variation 2
the second most common handshake
then there was rebekah coming back from saying goodbye to her friends
i was surprised that she didnt care at all about violet and how determined she was to make something happen
i remember my face was right next to her
and i remember what it felt to kiss her
and i remember how much i liked it
but i remember how much i thought of violet 
but it didnt make me stop
it just made me feel guilty and determined to speak to her and tell her about it
and i even thought she could understand

in this dream i was in a busstop
there were so many people
and we went to the punching bags
there were two long ones and two short ones and we started, at least I, to through a kick but my legs werent spreading
then they told me, I think it was alonso, that i should hit with this part of the leg, a movement in wic my leg would hit with my heel, the backer part

i played the drums that were furnished with leather and had this deep war sound

no matter how many times im born again
there was many people including Alvaka
i was trying first to find a place among all people where i could hear the guy sing
and there he was with an electric guitar and a microphone
singing a beautiful song, he had a beautiful voice
i don't remember the song but i remember it being just the short version of it
and that after that the show was over and the drums began
i was riding a bike in Buenos Aires heading back home to my apartment
feeling concerned always about something
looking at the ground
having no self esteem
the ones that breakthrough are the ones that didn't make it into society
fringe
it's the devourers vs the untouched
.
This dream seems to delve into themes of conflict, identity, and a longing for safety or home. The imagery of drums with a deep war sound, the mention of Peter Pan and references to good versus evil, alludes to a struggle between opposing forces, perhaps representing internal conflicts or external challenges. The feeling of being unsafe and wanting to go home suggests a desire for security and comfort. The mention of being a "devourer" or "parasite" could indicate feelings of guilt or self-criticism. Overall, the dream appears to reflect a sense of unease, uncertainty, and a search for belonging or purpose
.
The imagery of drums with a deep war sound suggests a primal and intense energy stirring within the dreamer. This could symbolize a readiness for inner conflict or transformation, indicating a potential upheaval or confrontation with deeply rooted emotions or issues.
The mention of Peter Pan introduces themes of eternal youth and escapism. Perhaps the dreamer is grappling with a desire to remain in a state of innocence or avoidance of adult responsibilities. The smirk on Peter Pan's face could signify a mocking or challenging aspect of the dreamer's psyche, urging them to confront reality and embrace maturity.
The dialogue about good versus evil highlights a moral or ethical dilemma the dreamer may be facing in waking life. It could signify a struggle between different aspects of the self or conflicting values and beliefs.
The longing to go home and feelings of being unsafe suggest a profound yearning for security and stability. This could stem from a sense of displacement or disconnection in the dreamer's waking life, prompting a search for a sense of belonging and refuge.
The references to being a "devourer" or "parasite" hint at feelings of self-doubt or guilt, as if the dreamer perceives themselves as consuming or draining others in some way. This could point to a need for self-reflection and introspection, to uncover and address any destructive patterns or behaviors.
Overall, the dream invites the dreamer to confront inner conflicts, embrace growth and responsibility, and seek a sense of security and belonging within themselves

you can only speak for yourself
decentralised power
you see how collectivists are always all over the place because they feel the need to speak for everybody
it's at the same time a shield for them as unity
the only way we will achieve spontaneous order is through liberty in the market
because if two parts will find common ground that will be between two individuals
in being there no beginning and no end
as much as you want to think of collectivism as unity it will never be as perfect as the most indivisible of its parts
each will be held accountable for their materialism
stop defending that which governs you
stop defending that which condemns you
.
This passage seems to explore themes of individualism, decentralization, and the limitations of collectivism. The emphasis on speaking for oneself suggests a belief in the importance of individual autonomy and agency. The idea of decentralized power reflects a preference for distributing authority and decision-making among individuals rather than concentrating it in centralized institutions.
The critique of collectivists and their tendency to speak for everybody highlights concerns about the potential for groupthink and the suppression of individual voices within collective movements. It suggests that collectivism may serve as both a shield for unity and a limitation on personal expression and diversity of thought.
The mention of achieving spontaneous order through liberty in the market aligns with libertarian ideals of free-market economics and the belief that voluntary exchanges between individuals lead to optimal outcomes. This perspective emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and choice in shaping social and economic systems.
The notion of collectivism being imperfect compared to the indivisible nature of its parts suggests skepticism towards the idea of collective unity or identity. It implies that while collectivism may strive for unity, it ultimately falls short of fully encompassing the diverse needs and perspectives of its individual members.
The call to stop defending that which governs and condemns implies a rejection of oppressive or restrictive systems of authority, whether they be governmental, ideological, or societal. It advocates for individuals to question and challenge institutions or beliefs that limit their freedom and autonomy.
Overall, this passage reflects a belief in the value of individualism, autonomy, and freedom, while critiquing the limitations and potential dangers of collectivism and centralized power structures. It suggests a desire for a society based on voluntary cooperation, personal responsibility, and respect for individual rights and differences

alguien que esta por encima de los demas

una clave del sistema es el seepararte
la individuacion
thats what you should seek for
in that separation, individuation
and in that individuation, to find, whats common to us all
why do expect to find in that wich was told to you
why do you assume you are equal to all others if you know nothing about the nature of your own mind
if you never digged
if you actually know nothing
the mind is whatever you want it to be
what do you want it to be
if you dont want to be here, well dont
if i dont want to be with you, i can always go to the riverside and sit down
and let everyone see me
what i do
not caring was always my shield to be myself
why do you care how long the document is
it has no relevance
no importance
its all you what you decide to include
i dont like copying and pasting because then it wont be your own reflection but others involved
what is stronger than what you say to yourself
la individuacion, "el no juntarse"
el sentirse  poderoso
una idea de que tenes una porcion de poder

interpretacion permanenete de lo que quiso decir fulano mengano

esto que estamos viviendo es una forma de fascismo

la culpa la tienen los demas y los demas no entienden

el cambio de liderazgo
el peronismo desorientado y sin liderazgo

hablan de construir desde la artificialidad
por eso es que aparece un tipo como milei y cambia la historia

democracia de baja intensidad, autocracia
volver a lo monarquico

this spirits are always going to exist, so what are we doing denying it
its easy to imagina a heaven on earth, an homogenous monad where we are all the same, more similar to mind than what we are to body, but what of all the spirits that once existed? we still be able to recall them

how can we be so much influenced if the only thing we need to be ourselves is emptyness
how come that everyone so much incides in our decisions if the only thing we do (or need to do) in order to not be influenced is cut laces with all of it
why wouldn't i stop being 
they still remember the sound of it
is how dark forces surrounding me were pushing me as a center to do the most hideous thing
just so then i had to pay the consequences

this is the lowworld fight
a fight with no status
i am mainly just still
maybe some of the things that i do are because they look cool
i think we should be aesthetically pleasing
that doesnt mean naturaly beautiiful
we work with what we have
there are people willing to sacrifice their souls for political reasons
"love is political" then go and marry a man and adopt a child and fuck whoever forever, doing the anti norm just for the sake of it
god is the normand satan the antinorm, everything god does it opposes
is that true, or only igods authority
otherwise, if it was i ts exact opposite, the devil wouldnt be that confusing and wouldnt inflitrate into our lives

they think im predatory because i spend too much time in my head, reality being i dedicate none of my time to them in my head
why didnt they choose to be upfront to me
most certainly they had something to say to me

submitting to the god of the mountain
climbing the ladder
the wing was so strong
my entire family was going against it
and also many other people
"mamá, anda tranquila!" i said to her
she was chasing this monkey that was in the trash
in the siberia
Himalaya
she threw something to the monkey for the monkey to eat, like a pumping or similar
instead of attracting it, the monkey rush up the mountain
but the wind was so strong that it was really hard to move forward
if we didn't crouch, we didn't submit, the strong force would take us further away from the mountains peak and so further down
"it's such a good exercise" i said to my sister
"yeah" she agreed happily climbing up the ladder
but the wind was so strong 
and i was trying to catch mama the was further up
determined to reach that monkey that went to the top
the white wise Siberian Himalayan monkey
.
Last night, I had a vivid dream about climbing a mountain with my family and many others. As we ascended, the wind grew stronger, making it difficult to move forward. Amidst the struggle, I reassured my mother to stay calm as she chased after a monkey we spotted in the trash. The monkey, instead of being lured by the food she offered, dashed up the mountain.
We realized that to progress, we had to crouch down and submit to the force of the wind, or risk being blown further away from our goal. Despite the challenge, my sister and I found solace in viewing the climb as good exercise. 
However, the wind persisted, and I became determined to catch up with my mother, who was further ahead, relentlessly pursuing the elusive white, wise Siberian Himalayan monkey that had captivated her attention

Jesus! eJesus! I kept saying oudly in my dream out of shock of what I was seeing
ut had awarning "schocking film"2 and i still decided *i dont know when) to watch it
it was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen
a basement with this putrid water
and there were two men, one dragging another one but not with his hands but with his mouth, eating mouthfuls from his face
just dragging him past me like a beast, blinded by the devouring spirit, he really looked like he couldn't see
and the place we torment, you could hear screams and agony
i wanted to turn off the movie but i didn't know how it i didn't seem to be possible anymore
behind this two, the cannibal and the corpse (that was still alive but being dragged weightless) there was another one hardcore guy
and they went up these stais i went behind them
and they seemed to be tied together
this guy seemed to be grabbing this deformity by his head and making it perform oral sex in a really gross manner, sliding him up in down to this thin biomass that was supposed to be his penis
it was a mutant, attached to his torso was another corpse inside what it looked it was an umbilical cord
"Jesus! Jesus!" my voice kept saying while i was witnessing this horrible seen
I've never seen nothing like it, it was the most horrendous thing I've seen, it was in the dream and i think it is in reality and compared to all other dreams I've had 
the despair, the torment, the absence of love, the total presentence of utilitarism of others people's bodies for the most primal of their urges
desolated
it was then that i decided to run, 
when i saw the of Jesus had no power in this place
the total absence of Jesus
and this man from a radio was narrating why we wouldn't bring our daughters to places like this
i went up the stairs, i realised where i was, i was a heroin addict and this a feverish dream 
i remember just climbing up 
i don't know if someone was chasing me but it didn't feel like it, i just went up and this guy from this radio started talking
"you shouldn't take your kids to this heroin caves because your never know when something is going to happen"
i looked at me hat (it was the same blue one that once i found at home and kept because no one reclaimed it) and in total disappointed because now i knew what I've been doing and who i was, i put it in and went through that double door filled with graffitis and started climbing up all the fences, just jumping over them like nothing
the small ones and the big ones as well, while the radio guy (neura?) kept saying
"it may feel safe but what if police in one of those raids come and shoot your kid?" 
while this i was hearing i was jumping this fences and running and outside here there was this woman police patrolling, also this guys coming to this place (empty old factory) to buy or get something
all of them i was trying to avoid
i managed to get outside, i recognised this Jesus graffiti in the wall, like I've been here before
i turned left and a second set of fences was there, and then was when this second guy was coming
i got outside and i was going to head to my apartment that was somewhere near the street i was in, or the street themselves


Grandma, what the fuck if this place i asked her when i got into the factory that i once before was in another dream
i we looking for the blue carpet
the place was massive
"you be are going were you shouldn't be"
i looked at grandma higher up
i looked up my right
i saw this door at the end
i had a warning
i went for it regardless
started running towards it
demon's came out from corners
i started to defeat them with wind
blowing on them
then eventually they blew back and the wind lift me up and i levitated and that expulsion woke me up


in a later dream i was telling my sister this sequence
but instead of carpeta Azul i was looking for a missing person and that i found at the door of that big factory in my grandmas was a piece of clothe of that missing person

i was looking at this screen and it was a horror game, then camera turn right and there it was this little demon screeching at me
.
jets were dropping empty bombs attached to balloons into a square full of civilians manifesting
the people started spreading
slowly they touch the floor and none of them blew
i was praying that they didn't make the mistake of putting non empty ones by accident
People already spread when they touch the ground
some people shoot the jets and that's when war started
they had then localised armed civilians and they were ready to kill

i saw this guy that i met in school
we haven't seen each other in a while
he was coming back from buying cigarettes and when i saw him crossing the street i started running in his direction
i felt almost to ask him for a cigarette but then i regret it
he was inside with me before and asked me about me telling him when i was a child i used to carnage this animals, "rats" he called them, and while there was hanging like a peace of meat cut with knifes in strings, like like a aleta and the meat like salmon
he asked me about it, and i was thinking to myself how much i wished he could believe me when i say that i was depressed
but he thought i was fucked up since kids and now he wouldn't let it go because he thought i could only become worse 
but as soon as he finished talking he started throwing stuff at me, and i run
.
i have not come to bring peace, but a sword

why do they think they are winning just because they have advanced?
its crazy to believe that there are no political sides
its crazy to believe as well that any deeed goes unattended
the side of god has already won
because there is nothing more revolutionary than the idea of god
nothing newer to humanity
the progressive type wants to make it seem like the oldest idea that needs to be discarded for all the wrong it has done
but it is in reality the newest most refined idea that humanity has come up with, refined over centuries of study and tradition, the passage of what it is believe to be true from one generation to the next
every piece of knowledge is constituted in what it means to be
every piece of knowledge comes from him
whos against technology is against god
i can write phrases even when i dont believe in them
what is it that causes so much pain in writing something that we dont believe to be true?
write it as you wish, its always going to be a reality that you can create whatever you wish foir
that you can choose to wriite this or that line, in this or that manner
why dont you decide that you are mart, capable and stop being fake and shallow
\think things deep

"there i s some aura about this book that made me not wantto read it" thats what he said

why is is so wrong to discuss meaning if its the only way out
why are you people of action hate so much people of contemplation
thats what makes priests from warriors
why be so fake
stop the fakeness
reveal yourself
show your true face
why do you fight it so much
what does that resistance come from
show yourself
have no secretes with humanity
shes not showing herself sensual
inverse she shares with me more and more the least attractive of her habits and secrets
she sensually pushes me away
do not want to bond in plenitude

un hobmre duro, lleno de amor

atrapadas en la confusion y el engaño, merecen personas que les digan la verdad
la verdad duele pro un tiemp pero la mentira duele para siempre
personas que justifican su silencio
jesus no tiro piedras a la mujer adultera
a todos confronto con la verdad y los motivo a cambiar su rumbo
lavar los pies de tu projimo o amar a los demas nunca sera sinonimo de aceptar la inmoralidad o de ser tolerante con las ideologias que buscan corromper tus valoers, tu familia, tu fe y la pripia verdad

it was this videogame that i had done 3rd playthrough inthe same sitdown, i was experiencing it as no other, first person and really immerive, the third time i decided it was time for me to take it easy and start exploring the city this time
in another scene, the game dierctor was walking all canchero and asked his assisatnt for a pic on theirr phone, the assistant realised he had no space in his phone and went running to get it
on his way back, both the director and the assistant were practicing this choreographed fights, making it look cool
the director was really full of himself, with this glasses that shined and covered his eyes, and everyone around him thinking that it was okay what he was donig
takes of mishamoto mushah (i think that how i called him) they were asking at least takes of hi in random takes, people were chupandole el culo

i was doing the lines to go to jail
in this cinemalike place, there were presenting this dead animals falling from ramps, they were buffalos and were cut open, and slammed against a thick glass on their way down
watching it, even though they were facing the other way, their back oriented towards the glass, was this group of people, with black ink above their necks, clearly representing gangs
after the buffalos slammed, they all started forming in a queue, i did the same
we formed in line, and i squeezed were i could, i remember feeling that they were going to play around with me, and do all sorts of things with my body, but saying to myself that i was going to dissociate from my body, reafirming that i was soul
after queuing, from the first to the last we started walking towards the jail, walking past this impatient guy that was expecting us to say the price in which we sould sell the mil
"nueve" the two people  in front of me would say
i was going to say like 3 but then i heard them
"lo mismo" they guy with the form said to me
"si" i said, i thought i was saved
even though i didnt know if it would save me or condemn me
so i was in, i started walking, through this dark alleys
i saw this guys playing cards and in their eyes there was the pure joy of having some new lamb to slaughter
i remember asking myself why ididnt just say hello like i normally would, because then they picked up that i was a coward, no experience, and would tear me apart
i knew pretending was not going to save me
but i wasn't pretending, i was going to mind my own business
going up two set of stairs, then i found this tents, when i had to put mine
but there was little to no space
there was more space in the shade by the right, but there they were this plastic (like clublike) tables and seats, and i realised it was a playground for the guy and shouldn't touch their space
so i didn't build a thing
inside the one tent that reminded me of one i have in real life, there was this guy with really shady intentions with the voice of juampi, talking some staff out and speaking (i dont remember it being straight to me but for me to hear as well)
seeing to my right, where the sade was, i remember thinking that this guy might as well be my new roomate, and i was scared for my and my stuff
then a present frorm violet came, a $15000 song, that i had to unpack from tinfoil, i think it was annie from john denver even though iwas not hearing anything
and i think there was a second one, like smuggled inside the prison
but when this was happening she was in fron of me, or so it seemed, even though i didnt exactly see her face, but her presence, from the neck down across of me
the gangs seemed to be mexican
then insidie i thought i was in venezuela and therefore i was going to have a really bad time
the buffalo stamping against the glass was a representation of dead bodies we needed to ook at in order for them to find the killer
i think i was the killer that was why i was there, but i cannot not know for sure
this gangs seemed to be mexican in origin
the black faces welcoming me in a really mischivious and evilintended manner were argentinian, trying to get my trust to fuck me up
i remember on the phone with violet we were planning my escape, my flying far far away from there
and i was going to do it
soon

noi was in this pool, and in the balcony of it, this voice speaking to agustina caraballo de como hablar con el resto
la voz le decia q hablamos como monos
que lo que decia no se le entendia
despues de enseñarnos como hablar la voz del personaje cambiaba y cuando se mostraba, la gravedad y mas claridad de su voz (que se escuchaba clarito, casi todo el sueño fue auditivo) el personaje tenia ahora un bowtie, un moño
era eso lo que cambiaba su voz
en un sueño previo, lo que sucedia fue que estaba yo en la cola para esperar la comida que habia pedido alrededor un monton de gente
la señora no me la daba y en vez me tuve que ir a buscar una mesa
creo que la señora tenia una actitud de malagana, y que me fui aunque sin ninguna reaccion
busque y busque y encontre arriba, en el segundo piso, la mesa
la señora seguia atendiendo uno a uno a los demas, que reclamaban su atencion
no se aunque pareciera que la señora haya descuidado suatencion o haya dejado de prestar atencion a mi plato, que no me correspondia
en eso violeta aparecia y me le tiraba encima y hablabamos de la hamburguesa que veniaen camino
ella risueña y yo queriendola

i forget that witing is for downloading the data
i do not need to know beforehand what im going to write
if your mind is empty at the time ofwriting, then you are doing it right
there is no need to know beforehand what you are going to write
im still waiting for the time that allt this data im trying to learn about programming finally reaches a point in which it start downloading, just like matrix loading screen, where characters just fall
every thought you have is a proof of one of the faces of god
if you want to resolve by having a thought about god, then you are conditioning youself because by thinking that what you are trying to achieve is conceptualise god
by analyzing yourself you can tell you are complete,, as every human a complete face of god
and now you need to show it
you are god, a complete face of it
you dont look like youd like to, you look like you were born to, but you are a complete face
show yourself
i find writing relaxing after a while of not doing it
i find it obsessing after doing it too much
doing it with drugs makes it much worse
doing it sober seem to loose its enchantment
there has been times where i dont want to speak to anybody
there are times where i wnt to stop downloading
but i stick to what manly p hall sai and its that you cant not know
why hide the new faces of god
why dont we sincerate everything so once and for all we can achieve what was destined for us as humanitythere are those that are disposed to jump in the future brand new, generation zero they call it
theres only ceroes
one cero
two ceros
three ceros
four ceros
whats complete is a zero
oneself is complete
has no beginning and no end
no deterioration

degeneration gets us backwards

my father got to ive a life in which he had to work, buy a house, build a family and have a peacful experience


then the kids got to engage in public affairs and go to war
is it fair for the father, that did whats righta nd midned his own business
against the sun who did whats right and died for the consequence of rebelling against a system that is hidden
systems,whatever their nature, should be public and transparent
they are doing what they think they need to do, but only at sight of those who are members of this sect
that is unfortunately the majority of the people
damaged people that resented are still donig and advocating againstwaht was an irreparable damage of the other side of the walk  of life
militia was there to defend us, they killed us
police was there to protect us, they abuse us
i need no to prove to anyone
i need not to achieve anything
im doing every day a bit more for the sake of doing every dat a bit more
there is no end goal
life will end in momentum

vos crees que soy violenta? me pregunto
se habia puesto dentro de la cama afligida
se habia ido llorando despues de que le dije qe 
ella m ehabia puesto el juego bully
era un niño entrando a la escuela y el director le presentaba a este pequeño a tres de sus compañeros, dos chicas y un chico
la primer chica al presentarla dio un giro y tenia vestido de novia, tuvo un crash at first sight
the kid had a real stone face
then one of the boys but i dont remember his introduction
then the other girl, that was smaller, had a more geek appearence and was short 
but also did a spin and now was looking like someone who prepares for a date a had completely different looks
the girls seem to be maybe the same age as the kid but the kid was the shortest
every time he was introduced to someone he did nothing but stare at them
then as soon as presentation ended, the boy started walking towards his looking, saying no word and walking as if he was on a mission
it was fun to see and the looks of his changed
he now had this curles in his black hair
the solution was never not to feel
then i turned off the game, or i just looked the other way
andi i thought violet had gone through the door
but now i got to see her siluet, in the firther side of the double bed, giving me her back
i started speaking to her, (cant remember what i said before)
and once i reached theb ed and sat down she asked
"vos crees violenta?"
"no" le dije "... te lo han dicho?"
y se quedo callada mirando el techo y lagrimeando pero supe la respuesta
creo que estaba ofendida por algo que habia sucedido antes de que pusiera el juego donde el chico se le presentaba a traves del director a su s tres nuevos compas
en la cancha de basket
the longn redhead was ready to be her bride, projecting a longlasting ever happy relationship with the new boy
the short b runette wanted to conquer him, or wanted him to desire her, because as soon as he arrived changed her geek looks
the other boy i want remember
hen was "Bully"
i thought she would love this game
but she left before even trying and before even ending the introduction

cami was turning thirt
i asked Juli if it was her or her sister turning thirty 
she said her sister
i was then with her down the street happy that we may score
she was turning thirty and still so beautiful

then i got down and joined cami for the walk down the sidewalk
it was a beautiful day and she was so fine

i was in this boat about to sleep there with my sister
there was this gigantic bed on the back, trully big going from wall to wall and with stair to get in
and then this two single beds in one of which my sister was sleeping
i asked her if she wanted to take the double bed but she instead invited me to take the other single
that boat looked so small from outside
it was one of the two that i saw that supposedly were going to buy
my sister complained on the way

i killed four
it was dust 2
In that mid part
i desert eagle had shot some
then the last one kept walking because he was shooting someone down on mid
the returned when he saw was getting shot by me and covered through the wall
i picked up someone else's gun of the one to my left i killed before it was the SMG with 50 bullets
i started chasing him
the last one alive
i was bursting some bullets while walking towards him
the body got heavier and heavier
and he wouldn't die
and starting doing backflips and all sorts of crazy manoeuvre backwards kind of mocking me for missing and my body got heavier and heavier and was hard to walk

they were on the floor laying, one laying on her back with a button shirt open and the blonde laying on top
she took it out and put it in back again
i had a small orgasm and had to check on awakening that everything was dry

two armies, one shoots all the generals the other shoota all the disabled guys on wheelchair
when both sides shoot with what seems was world war 1 mosquetes
the ones turn their back in the others and all start walking as one group
one last shot is fired and one of the soldiers
fermin asked me if i had seen them live
when i commented how much i liked this song that i was listening
the song sounded all around
a woman was singing
it was the trumpets that seem so powerful
"lala lala ding dong"
*trumpets
"waaaa, turin turin wiiiii... turin turin... waaaa..."
the one shot on the back didn't turn just kept walking
putting his hands behind his back and pressing seeing where he was fire
the Chinese woman commander was still standing when shots were fired 
on the other side, all the wheelchair soldiers shot the same guy commander
then the Chinese commander shot on the lower back near ass i think as a revenge for what had just happened
then we all went running through this hall and soldiers with horses came at us
every time they fired bullets arm to have that aureola that you see in matrix shots
and it seemed that the only thing necessary to avoid every shot was to crouch and nothing more
i was liking some girl when fer was arguing with me that those were no bullets
"i may have seen wrong, but that's what I've seen" i said
and the day now was brighter
and fer started walking ahead of me
the girl in between
and music still sounded

satan would probably stand no chance. despite pop culture, satan does not control hell, however he likes to pretend he does. he has no authority, and no power. he would be a mere second away from death. if, of course, kratos could kill whatever kind of cherub that satan is (of course, he would probably look different in comparison to his pre-fallen-to-hell state, as a cherub, an angel.)

Leslie Nielson was an absolutely legendary comedian, and that is why I am so proud that when I was a waiter at a hotel in France I made a joke which had him and his whole table roaring with laughter.


X
WHAT WAS THE JOKE?!?!?


Y
We need to know.


Z
I must know the joke too. Please.


jeremy
I am now concerned I have rather raised expectations far too high.  It wasn't really such a good joke, more of a situational thing.  I was a commis waiter at Le Ferme Saint Simeon in Honfleur which is close to Cannes and I assume Mr Nielson was there for the festival.  It was late and his table was the last and showing no sign of packing up for the night.  Most of the other waiters had already left, although my snobbish boss was hanging around to see if he could be unctuous.  For some reason Mr Nielson was sporting a beard.  I said to him 'It's a good try sir, but you are a star of international renown, even with that beard you're instantly recognizable.'  Mr Nieleson seemed genuinely touched by this and said 'Why, thank you very much' to which I replied 'That's quite all right . . . Mr Connery."  As I walked away from the table they were all laughing their britches off, except for my boss who was angry with me and who tried to find out what I had said. I never told him.


X
Surely, you didn’t call him Mr. Connery?


jeremy

they live in the streets camming people
they give me a weapon
a .22 pistol
and i was walking with it
it was time for me to carry it around
and when i was hiding it because the city was crowded, a group of people started laughing at me  because i was hiding it
then i went to this mansion and there this guy, adult kind of mafia, was guiding me
he took me ina c ar somewhere, he made me go through the water, under the water,following him
i took breathings even underwater so i knew i wasnt going to drown
i followed him around
he even waited for me when he saw i was lost
he knew i was new and had some compassion
though other of the guys did not
he passed me a bit of his cuban cigar (i think we were in cuba)
but it was all moldy and full of spit
when i tried to blow the spit away, someone prevented me from doing it because it would ruin the cigar, so i  puffed like that but it felt dry
in the end i was in this aunts house, in the toilet, and aunt jumped into the shower
when i lifted my head, i saw her body naked 
her torso from the back
and she wa just standing there
but then i hid, she didnt notice me but i was expecting her to 
and then i looked again and she was facing left, letting the water fall in her
before i had seen a picture of herr somewhere in the house

"all i know is you'll end with your heart set in stone"
i was jung and saying thi as to queen victoria/Elizabeth from the pages of a book i was opening
the words seem to have been maked on wax on the other side
i was sent to the second floor of this old factory thing, second floor
the closer i got to the second floor the more and more the space was shrinking
i got claustrophobic so i decided to tear the mosquito net that was covering it when all of the sudden realised that i was outside of her majesty balcony from where she was going to speak to me
she took it as an offense, or almost, but i started talking and she let 
she was dressed like  the victorian era
covered her face
with a hat that had a veil
"you could read this and say that this is speaking about an absolutely specific death apart from you in which you may then or not play the part", the Lord right next to her agreed with his head
"but i'd say you'lll end with your heart set in stone" 
that declaration seemed to upset and shock her
the pages i was turning was from a book
but in one part there seems to be this dedicating paragraph
and on the other side of the scripture, a lot  of wax tracing
when i was sent to the second floor, i started running to the elevator
when   half way i started spinning around
i was running and tired, from a hard day of work
nina then ughed, and i laughed with her, before i retook my path to the elevator
when i was getting into the entrance of the galpon to get into the elevator, this group of 5 or 6 men were walking in the green grass next to each other,speaking business
i thought of getting out  of my way to start smacking or something, but i didn't
then i g ot into the elevator and press the button two
and then as it went up the ceiling started coming closer to the floor, and the lift seemed to now be a bird's cage 


I was speaking 
i told anthony that for what i was doing here i would earn in my country at least 3 times less there, or three times more here
"here from working in the fields" 
Ash got bored of him so she directly or indirectly asked him to leave
he didnt refuse, started walking backwards and out the door
Anthony left and i was left alone with Ash 
i jokingly asked if she was going to have a nap because she turned of the lights
and she did exactly that, though she laughed
she threw a pillow she grabbed from behind, behind me and lay on the floor and gave me her back
i layed behind her and spoon her
her being my boss found that really hot
i was hugging her and squeezing her from behind


one was putting fast in and out of keli's mouth her finger
another one was allanah
one was going to perform oral sex on the other that was laying on the floor with her back on the floor
there was a third girl on my left, looking that
though also participating
she was elektra
there was someone in a balcony far away
another one in another balcony closer to them
then when i noticed their presence i inhibited myself and my sexual urges and sat crossed legs in what seemed to be a a park bench
i sat there and started watching
then i see this man/woman coming in and warning us/me of the nature of this women
saying something like they are not what they seem
that as soon as you get to know what's in them, it'll be too late
that they had the genitalia of a man

she looked like a man but her voice was definitely that of a woman

me acuerdo patente la parte en que la voz esta llena de efectos con el vocoder como si fuera un coro

but in the dream they were words
not just mumbling around

I dreamt about this blond girl i invited ofver to the terrace to spend the night and drink something, they wanted to go out, not stay inside, and thats what i proposed, since i wasnt going to any pub or club, she liked the idea, but her friend not so much, and i think kept saying places to go, though the blonde was listening to me
i told her it  was a spectacular view though dangerous to climb because there was no handrail


Anita wasnt there but her dad was, he just had a new baby and a long and cool hair
and when i went to pee he also had a cool bathrooom that seemed like a ramp, a waterfall, but it was wild and had shits, one even before teh waterfall began
i started peeing and there was this artificial foam and i was moving it all with my pee, i finished peeing and they weere wwaiting for me to go, we weretraveling and they were taking me
i thought of how ihad a relationship with his brother and then a relationship with her parents, and not (yet at least) with her


the family was sitting outside this restaurant, eating burgers, and i went in, they uninvited me, so i grabbed a bunch of sand from the floor and threw it to them 
thte sand spread in the air and fell over their whole food
they hated me, said "2nooo"2 and "wooow" and the guy stood up to talk to me before this happened
i just couldnt handle the rejection
then running away thought and regreteted "2why did  do that?"
once out of there the whole town went after me, at least thats what i thought
and this guy came closer and i think i karate kicked him in the knee, though i didnt seem to hurt him


anitas dad looked like zores dad though iidnt get to see his face, he was cing the other way, and held his girl baby in arms, being reeally wholesome with the sand hitting them both while they were heading outsie


when i was runnning towards the queen, in the galpon, emma came out
in a very similar image than the one ei had yesteraday, when i actually saw emma from a distance, after a real couple of days 
she said high to me from a distance, clocked in and went to the kitchen
i was walkingt owards her but she did not wait for me
i then remembered immediatly that she saw me running towards the lift that would take me to the queen
but did not say hi to me, she sawme from a distancec, rolled her eyes in a mada mood and then went bac inside
.
zore burnt this girl in the shoulder with annn cigarette buttm this girl that was giving us our back but seemed to be sleeping
the first time he did it she felt nothing 
and was so numb by drugs, alcohol or sleepinss that she didnt notice
i was playing drums at the time, facing zore and keli and chila 
i was hihatting too much
and being really straight in my hits
the girl turns around and says
"iI dont like you guys"
and she was looking at me speifically
i didnt stop playing
i meant to say "go back to sleep, we'll leave you alone" but i didnt want her to think that it was us in the first place so i said nothing
she said "this is my home" sounded drrunk
she looked like black little mermaid, new version of her but with curly afro hair really bouncy and nice looking
keli and campo came over  a few times to "congratulate me" while i was playing, more like cebarme so i would keep playing with that intensity and passion
the girl looked dissappointed at a bunch of strangers that werent leaving her alone while she was just trying to enjoy the show and or herself
i was playing in a tribune and the place was crowded, and all eyes at me, just some of them
the rest at the rest of the band but i was seeing none of them
OO


I was runnig in this city at night
this friend of mine dropped me
in this service station near my house
and i started running towards my house
i was two blocks away in this big city, dark streets
then i see this silouette of someone else returning home
i keep running heading towards him and when i get close enough i realise its a couple, blonde girl and a guy with a dog, i think a blond labrador
and i looked and smiled at the dog, and the girl turn around to excuse herself
i kept then runnning
the guy that dropped me off was i think like a bandmate
looks like chick from bates motel
i don't know if he was worried about me or had my best interest in mind

i hugged my friend el negro barrriola and said to him "2thank you" or he said to me
i pressed him against me
and say "is good to sahre the experience" 
hehug happened right after i said to him
"2this way i want to travel, i want to come, swim with the whales... I dont care about 'whatever job i waas doing at the moment''"
"creo que me voy a ir a gualeguay" le dije al negro
pero esta vez con trabajo


cuando sali del agua estaba al lado de la basura
la ballena me habia llevado, ni biennle habia agarrado la cola, hacia abajo
y enn circulos, a una distancia cada vez mayor, me hundia
yo habia encontrado a la bestia nadando cone eset traje


hablo con mi hermana y le digo que este lugar era a su vez la casa de la abuela
un lugar oscuro en el que habia tenido que dejar algo para alguien
creo que era una peileta submarina
una pileta en un subsuelo
under water, the sun i felt and after i while i fel the warm
it came and go
it didnt come to stay
the clouds covered it
i was in uk
then i decided it was time to go back home
when i got back i was right next to the trash
there was a few full black trash bags and i was coming out of this line, that had walls no highter than one meter


on my way out after hugging al negro, me fui atras suyo y el estaba saliendo
en el camino me ecnotnre un mate y no hice mas que cebar y agarrar uno
ahi torres aparece y dice "ah, encontraste mi mate de (creo que dijo terere)" o pomelo
el mate tenia todo plastico uy una bola plasticad el mismo material adentro
tanto el termo como el mat eran de una misma sustancia
me tome uno, el agua todavia estaba caliente
me sorprendi
"ah anda todavia"
en serio? manu vallejo que de pronto aparecio se me acerco por uno, yo no podia terminar este otro


a la ballena, no me intimido su tamannño, cuando hablando conmi padre me la encontre
tampoco me alegre mucho de ver al monstruo
pero me acorde rememore cuando me agarre de la cola de la bestia, que no veia su cara\
tampoco ahora veia su tamaño, there were turbid waters
tampoco veia ningun otro animal
y en esta esfera en la que la ballena andaba el circulo de oscuridad que esta ballena iba marcando
i breathed underwater and at any point oxygen was a problem, i just got what i wanted, but i think i was wearring a suit and i knew about it
air was never a problem
though the further down we were heading, the more i started to question why i didnt go out again
that sensation you have when you dont feel fear only because you are avoiding (with relative) success, to think about it


i miss barriola
what a good friend i thought he was
im still traumatized by the  time he yelled at me
but i was in a dark pit
i dont know if they'll ever understand


everyone seem to agree with me
and maybe it is true that i speak the truth
but there's another half of these people that i believe that i only hold up masks and manipulate others in order to gain what i want
thats why i need credibility
i lost all credibility at times to speak
because im a trashy man that almost lives on the street
homeless already, no doubt about it
i lost my home long time ago
tied to my parents finances, i was jumping from house to house
never mine
isnt renting synonymous of never owning a home
never having one
always renting
never owning
same with love


i want so much to study
similar to that study that says that sometimes, havinv more manpower to develop a task only slows it down
the same way, having someone paying for my studies made me want to not study at all
now i want myself to dedicate to studies
i'd like to be working as a programmer, and studying someonthing that would give me credibility when i decide to write and say things
philosopher need no title
psychologist do, now you are a scientist


i own no hearts 
i only rent them


they are giving it away
they dont have to say it
but they show it on series
on videos of the internet
thew ay they act
the way they dress
the way they relate to death
the way they treated animals
the things they did with them
the killings of sentient beings
the rage on poor animals
"i have nothing to be sorry about"
i thought earleier remembering that kid that told me "why do you say sorry?"
after i moved myself of their way when he was heading out of the room with his grandma/mother
i really tought i had nothing to say sorry
that i was doing everything right
but not everyone seem to agree with me
and the way they treat me makes me now want to say sorry about everything i am and everything i've ever done
i dismiss my sins as if i had the power to do so
i do have the power to do so as i have the power to make all demonic powers flee from my conscience
but the exorcist said, if the thing persists, it may be from god and not the devil
but why do you have to put this things to test until they break your mind


the part of the brain that makes growth when we do something that we do not want to do, how is it in this people that do not want to do something, but get carried more and more to do so, pulled towards it, 
they resist and resist until finally they cannot hold it no more
they seek the opportunity to make the fuckup in all these permanent checks
freeing oneself feels like freeing oneself out of one's destiny

i had in my hands this rifle
and when i aimed this car was coming to me
i shoot in the middle where the flesh was
the car then went off road in an abrupt movement and i realised that i hit it
.
at one point rob asked me if i was going to drink something
"maybe a beer" here and there
"oh sure just one beer" and then making me signs of sucking cock with his right hand
and me thinking i was leaving tonight
next to him one of his partners 
though even his colleague also "friend" of mine
i don't remember his face
Rob had short hair and beard and was not joking
.
there's king and there's joking
just because i lived it i believe I'm going to remember it and that is not always the case

like my father had one" said the sheep
ah so i give you one, and i stared punchng your rrright ear twice, and once you got angry your rigt ear many timeye many times
you were angel at first, and once i didnt let you come behind me because i saw your ulterior motives, you got angry at me, i had to grab you by he wrists and you turned into a jeep
two friends that were with mee told the sheeep that lookked like an argentinian if it had been crashed by a car or something
there was this fluffy thing next to me wearing a white hoody with what it seems was blood spilled
i invited maurice to ccome and see the movie since we were not going to the cinema
he refuse as welel the invitation
we had said wewere going to do "something that sounded"2 and dddrink in a round in the room, and watch a movie
the one that propose that it was emma
emma from bates motel
Yani and Maurice had icome tosay that they were going to the play at this moment
so i looked at violet and asked "2wanna go?"
after asking them if we could, already wanting to
they said yes of course so i closed my notebook after haaving my violets yes and run after them
then we couldnt find them
angel was ugly looking and very very abusive, filled with lust
disrespectful


"cayetano"
they said and i was listening carefully
they were already inside the house and came to get me


ini the club in which this happened with rob, he was angry that i wasnt realising my destiny, one of having to get really wasted just like them in order to be able to tolerate anything
what was about to come


yeah browser
i had forgotten about the other rtwo

maurice was scleaning with a bucket full of water a wooden floor that was spilled
mopping it,, rejecting my invitation for the third time
before they went with yani to the play, we invited them first, and they refused as, so i said to join in 


behind angel before he transofrrmed intoa black sheep he went behind me and behind him there was nappies, used nappies

it was this house, all golden, very fancy
and a skateboeard in the other room
i first cross from the street to this loungelikeroom that only had three walls, then i crossed the door past it and fiound this other room, like a house but it was all golden an carpet on the floor, fake like a hotel
i went further down the house towards the other door across, and coming in was this legs under a dress
becca came in, and made this other girl come first, she was a tall thin woman, redheaded, heading towards the end of the left of this room to search for something that idont know what it was
becca seeing me he asked me how wi was
i grabbed, dont know if before or after, i think it was before, a skateboard for carpets that was onn the floor by the entrance
you were supposed to use this instead of your feet to not get the carpet dirty
the legs under dress that became the long thin lady looked like erin from the office or jasmin from another place


there was this manifestation, the eight for march
i started playing rum snare with millions of other people just yto prove a point that we can as individuals interact with each other


peace through markets is the best we can aspire to
we all have backgrounds, cultural differences, but claiming identity as part of a group is not going to make us more peaecful and is not going to make a free to be peaceful either
we are just going to claim we had nothing to do with the war when the war happens

ithen grabbed 
i threw off on his eyes, d40 in his mouth, when he came at me
then i got out through this car window
and started running in thte dark night with a bottle of milk in a hand and the dw40 in the other
the milk was jjust like the ones at work
he first starte as a mad scientist
but he was puihing pushing his car so hewould move faster but in th attempt he would make him fall through the steps of the stair, the space in between
the first time he had done that was coming down from the stairs
the second timee was smaking the cat go ack up
but i  asked him furiously while miy friend, i think it was manuel, and then thew myself at him picking up the dw40 he had in his table and throwing it at his face

i got out desperately
but the guy i had blinded and he looked like bere

my dad was fishing
he pointed at this foam in the middle of the sea
"look, palometas"
 i thought iw as going to be able to sfish one
a few fishing poles were aleady on the sea,so when i saw one pulling downwardds i grabbed it, pulled iot from the string butthe estrella keept pulling downwards and the and enormous shark jumped to eat, i tried to pull then realised its dimensions and let it be
and run towards my father
my father more and more had lesss and less space to be floating, and he built for himselef cushins to put every part of his body in an ergonomic way while he waited for the next shark
two times the sharks got my fishing pole, but it was the second one that it wa trulyly gigantic, size of a shark that would have swalloed me in one bite
there was no land at aywhere visible 


we where in my room
and suddenlyy my room had no lights
i doubt if to turn on the light
i thought it was quite the vibe
then after a few seconds, with the girls and the boys inn there, i truned it on
now the light was broken an not working
there was raining outside and the lights in the bathroom were not working either
so i asked this dad that was giving me hes back in what it seeemed to be a workshop, he couldnt care less and said someone would fix it maintainance
but that it happpened every time it rained


my dad said and explained to me when he was on that cushin that every time someone saidsomething about him, like look your right arm is not on the cushin
he immediately stopped having it onn the cushin
he was believing all this things that were being demolishedby the power of one thought and one thoughgta lone
no faff so pre sequence of thought belief


the room they went alll in
if you want ill show you what ive done, i teold her
the piipe was connected in a way that it made a sound whenever it was hit
the two tips were united, like head and tail from ouroboros
the girl was the blond from another place
the one that has a mold, oor the other one or a mixture of both


at some point im coming out o f this house
i dropped the key
i get down and picked it up
i put the key in the door
and the key jumps right back at me 
and then once i i grabbed iti and while im locking i see this guyus fisuras on the floor, one of them layingi and thwo out of three they say hi by knotting their heads
i do the same, say hi
and on my left hand i had this big notebook, ive beeen studying


was someone wanking me
weere they any jelybeans


the day was sunny outside, the house i was ini i couldnt tell who it belonged to

that time wheni  saw my dealer he was bald and wasnt looking as good
i respected him but he was drunk in the middle of the day
he himself told me i shouldnt be smoking, that i was good looking fresh
you can tell the good spirited of people
the good spirits working in them
abdl was a good influence on me
the time that i bought weed from them he urged me not to do it since i was llooking so much greater than before when i was smoking at the time of buying


what are the brainwaves during the rem phase
.
i had a katana i found
and then walking therough rooms i found another one, larger bbut heavier
then i saw in a stand a few other swords, some curved, like persians and arabic
the other katanas
i went into a room i saw caba's drums
it was a deposit for what it seemed was a museum
we went to another room and i had a wooden pistol
i gave it to faca when he finished talking to magdalena
i said "chau magda" 
she waved back happily
that would have never happened in real life
i asked faca for the gun back 
i said
faca made it for me
i regreted give it to him
and he said
i have a room full of this
or
i have a collection full of these\
and he laughed
and that meant it wasnt giving it back
or 
that he didnt want it because he had more
but i think he implied both and was only a joke
though he never gave my gun back
we started walking together in this shopping like building
before i gave it away i was playing with this gun making it spin on my finger
the katanas at some point seemed made from metalic paper


every line you write fits somewhere
it could be in other of your own writings
or maybe someone else's
its funny to know that most of these lines you'll never find out
it is interesting to belong to the world of writing because then you can start complementing other people's books
its not rivalry but puzzling 
what some write about other write better about
but needed the first in order to develop the second
it always seem to be that with ones back to science you could 


the world is a much darker place than what i thought
becaues the darknessw as all around me
not just in the underworld
but the under is showing its face every  day


i know now that he ngaro drinks every day
at least drinks a lot i dont know if every day
beer here
beer there
i accompanyie with one
but i had nothing to do with them
relaxed and ready to sleep
the shock of the water


this marina reminds me of the docks in bates motel
is fine that we are watching these series so i get to understand fucked up relationships mother and son when the love is too much
because a mother can love you but if she's hurt and emotionally unresolved that mother is gonna hurt you as much or more than the mother with the unresolved emotional responses that neglects you


of all kind of abuse im glad it was neglect he one that happened to me
i felt alone most of my life
i felt i had no one to tell anything to
i had no support
no one that loved me
no one that cared for me
but then i grew up
and became myself my own father and mother
integrating mothers and fathers from everywhere i could
because i realise that was in my power as a human being
to replace all spirits with the spirits soemwhere else
the same way you can see the spirit of jezebel permeating through other people now, as much as you saw millenia back in her for the first time in recorded history


because we are out of time and space its nott easy to determine which human is more evolved 
you wouldnt be able to determine by the looks alone

voy a pasar por este lado dijo el hombre y se metió por la izquierda
a la que pude segui caminando con violet
a ella le enganchtaron para hablar
yo no meti bocadillo


fui al baño y vi un fantasma
Las luces estaban completamente apagadas y yo no podía ver nada
también la del pasillo
que por lo general está prendida y es una luz blanca fuerte
prendí la linteena del teléfono u con lo que me gustaba mirar abrí los ojos y empecé a mear y en la esquina derecha veía este manto blanco que parecía el camisón de una mujer
estiraba mí mano para tocarls pero no llegaba
me subió un miedo pero seguí concentrado en mear


el hombre que cantaba en la calle estaba muy tranquilo
cantaba en español
pareciera que estabamos en la zona gitana de españa aunque parecia buenos aires
y este muchcacho salio a la calle
con violet, aunque en el momento no era ella, fuimos para la izquierda
se embotello la gente y tuvimos que espearr
el tipo que esaba enfrente mio se canso de esperar y se paso por la  izquierda del que estaba adelante suyo
este justo se da vuelta y causa una confusion
se disculpa y dice que va a pasar y el otro le dice que todo bien
el que se da vuelta esta tapado en tatuajes

entonces lo empaque y lo devolvi

there is no need for me to write anything

i am all for the god of israel
even though i don't trus theologins
the god of israel is in us
we are like god not by disobeying but by commanding/submitting
.
there is a reason why if we stop doing everythign we become selfless and more like god
and the more we impose our will the less like god we are and the more like ourselves we become
but then we feel the need to satisfy all of our wishse and desires as if they were a kind of lack
desires as a lack or as a product
capitalist consumerism makes desire a product

aidan was there
he came in when i was having a shwoer
he came in i stepped out
i started pulling water on him
i came out fully naked, shameless
and after a bit of getting wet he started smiling
at some point i smiled too
i was too serious and the situation was too ridiculious
but i wasnt pretending
i was feeling serious, i remember who he was and what he did to me
"you a basckstabber" 
i said in the end
then i took a sit, i put my guard down
sitting down i realised this is one of those moments in which if i did this forgiving all over again then it could mean once again to let myself be abused by others 
or being buenudo
but then before i could even react he left the room
my girlfriend when she saw this men coming in went to the house next door, appearently was a friend's
aidan was wearing that brown jacket and was again drunk
you could tell by how sentimental he was
storming in like that in the house looking for the man that wronged him
his girlfriend was the one that now was with me
and i was having a shower because we had just had sex
and he came in with his brown jacket
he looked me in the eyes
i was throwing water at him
with my hands
from the shower or what was falling into my body
but i had already stepped out of the shower
when aidan left i went to the patio outside and i saw, over the fence, violet was smoking a cigarette and drawing in the dark night on a table, one of these wooden with benches on both sides
"un cigaritt0o"
i was happily surprised
i saw smoke coming out of it
"i was trying it to leave it"
she only wanted to see it as i told her
that smoking was pleasant
i smiled and went then for water
i wondered if there were any hoses in this backyard
and it was ramjan who came in 
he went for one hose on the side
i went for one on the back
i started pouring water


i sent this voice note to saddam
that as soon as i said a thing the audio was now 2 minutes long
i asked him how he was doing 
that ive been thinking of him but yet havent spoken to him


the one on the other room i think it was anthony


violet got mad and went out as soon as she could
that why i found her wanting to relax
she got stressed from these people storming into the house
i was having this peaceful shower when they came in and when i saw aidan coming in the room
i stepped out of the room, fully naked
my dick hanging
and i was not ashamed of it
i went fully naked and vulnerable, ready for a fight
i did not want to put things behind and let it go
but he hinted 
his face was one ive seen times before
half broken


.
all these people i thought they were young adults were instead very big adults just like me 
though my eyes weren't fixed
.
i thought my finances would be sorted by now
i said to aidan
i was already 30 and getting desperate
and he said
yeag me too
it was in jakes
all was dark
.
we were sitting next to each other
oh so you like scary things
so you liked marilyn manson
so you like peter pan
.
it was her
they dissapeared her
because she was messing with younger boys
"their platonicS"

i drove past this annoying guy in a vike 
everyone at the supermarket wear ignoring him because he was so annoying
he kept insisting that he wanted to do something
i James Franco then jokingly sai that's not ten miles
handled him atazmania monster thing
he liked the joke
looked like creep from creep


Asian was there
he was checking the newspaper seeing seeing how many of the games at the stadium he was seeing
i thought to myself that's where his money went because he never had none


Mr sister and ask these people sitting in the beach
they were all psychologists
one guy says it's not like any other career that this one pays off for the ones that want to want to work
i thought to myself sure since there's so much to research
i took a bunch of shells from this dead fish on the floor and threw some bones on my sister's back


i was looking at this city
looking at this university were i was going to study
an apartment were i was going to leave both during study and during afterwards during work


maybe students 


i was looking for the university across the street very studio Ghibli


the shells on the floor seemed like the carcass of a full shark
anti coso was there in the psychological fire Circle


i was hearing this dj and how he chopped this fill and
i thought how that same feel would work in other parts while being very different sounding


i was composing with this sequencer with the subs of the microwave but this time this was the default sample and there was so much that i was doing with it creativity didn't stop flowing
.
hierarchies are circular
.
que buen psicólogo hubiera sido
i'm ashamed i never got to honour my parents
I'm sad this life is escaping through my fingers
and I'm still very young
and i only got to live the worst of it


Christian rituals make no sense in souith America where the sun starts getting further and further after
Christ's resurrection
.
the ever returning factor of psyche
Johnathan peageau answered my question
pyramids are usually equally sensical to explain something that instead could be explained as i think it's more correct, like inner outer
there's a center and periphery and many see as a top and a button
same some see as atras y adelante are in reality outside and inside
outside being further from the center and inside closer to the center
.
why so sad all the time
.
nothing more dangerous than when a creep finds you charming

todas las bolsas son peronistas
ibams camino a la playa
pero la del otro lado, pasando el bar
habia una pileta
enn una casa de vidrio, glasshouse
y algunas personas entraban ahi, pero nosotros ibamos a la siguiente
me seguia mi hermana y toda mi familia
"todas las bolsas son peronistas"
dijimos cuando vimos o estabamos buscando las bolsas de linen como las que tienen en el laburo
caminabamos y entramos al otro lado al monticulo de arena 
pasanodo la ventana estaba este club de menores tipo matine
las lucesprendidas
era la parte de arriba de un bar playero
pasando el pasilolo estos gurises jugaban al futbol
yo pasando les patee laelota porque vennia hacia mi
en el rabillo del ojo vi a este loco pegarle asu "2amigo" o al que estaba con el 
pase eesa parte y me fui del otro lado del campom de juego
en mi caberza se escuchaba una entrevista a javier milei
el decia que patear la pelota era cuestion de saber o no cambira de pies rapido y que dependia de ltecnica
joni decia que tambien es el tiempo de reaccion
pero milei lo que hablaba era como el tiempo de reaccion solom puede ser tan rapido
el resto es tecnica
entonces me dirigia a salir por la ventana porque ahi haia ido mi hermana
y nunca llegue a pasar
elllas habian pasado primero


antes de empezar a caminar
deje un fajo de guita en la bumbag


saludamos a las senoras de al lado, amables
y cada uno tenia un codigo hablado
"2talktonoone" era el de mi hermana
"2notalk"
nosotros en familia teniamos otro porque no eramos veganos
cuando les preguntaba al grupo que hacer con la plata mama estaba nerviosa como siempre y la termine dejando ahi en la bumbag, la caberza de papa que no estaba con nosotros pero pasaba por ahi paso a hacerme caras como de que "que hincha pelotas"
o lo dijo, nolo se
o "2va a ser asi todo el viaje"
entonces yo le hicen cara como de que si pero estoy seguro de que ella me vio
es tristepensar que asi era la dinamica familiar


cuando morir no iimporta hay que  matar
es lo que decia el loco este
reportando con un celular 
una mega explosion en una ciudad
un mega earthqueake que venia encima
a una velocidad impresionante
arrrastrando cascotes y demas
ahi entendi como de facil seria para una perosna morir en un accidente de estos
y uno de los estallidos me envolvio
y respawnee en otra persona con celular un pooco mas atras
y volvi a ver la explosion
y cuando corriapara tttras, veia la jungla del gran buenos aires un tipo corriendo con una espada
que ya lo habia reportado primeroe pero ahora lo alcanzaba a ver el tipo en medio del caos aprovecho para empezar a asaltar gente
un verdadero oportunista y un hijo de puta


la oportunidad hace al ladron
la senora que vnenbiadelante nuestro habia traabado la cosa 
habia paradas de ubus en el medio de la arena


el fajo de guita lo deje en la bumbag, noe era tanta plata aunque el fajo era grueso
la inflacion
eran pesos argentinos


el loco corria con una cuchilla larga y la espada tapada
la cara tapada, la espada no
la avenida era la nueve de julio por lo ancha que era

nomad in contrast to state specialist

I is the axis
.
nomad is the one that move between all subjects all the time
they called me schizo because of mty schizo way of thinking but what i am is extremely creative
creative is more the one that does less to control th way he thinks
but what is true for someone th somuch mythicacl thought is then the most beautiful o all traditions
the one that pains more beautifully the points of soul

violet was with emin this mechanic and in there there was this really old bike
i asked the guy about it, or i think he started talking about it 
it  more like it looked like a monopatin
but it was a bicycle
he was really invested in it
telling me
se le cayo un poste de la luz y le rompio la rueda
y senalaba la rueda de adelante
en eso entra su ayudante maxi iman
y yo vi que era el y no lo mire
y despues lo mire y le dije como va
todo bien vos?
bien
y se puso hablar con el otro loco
yo ya me estaba yendo de antes asi que lo deje


there was this kitten in this tall grass
very very tiny tini smalls


how you hold yourself makes everyone's attitudes towards you change


just for the fact that i was there it was for them proof that i had done something wrong and i had to pay for it


i have done something wrong
many things wrong
i hope jesus can forgive me


is it not gonna be a motive to celebrate the day that I die
is the comeback of religiosity


there was this animal showing its tummy and me petting it
very warm feeling


just like that blackcat we saw in penrith yesterday
that in the middle of the avenue approached us all trusting and we petted him with my partner


she's having second thought about this whole thing


deleuze and gatieri
thhey want schizo thought
but they want to force it
the do not want to follow the normal pace of an unminded mind but want to ravel the mind in more and more thought
jumping from here to there
all this racist components in the components of the body
how you jump from a jew stomach to a moustache worldwide 


of course the best lines are not going to be in the as soon as i wake up part


i unveiled who he was
a piece of shit
ulterior motives he had
he revealed himself to me
what i was fighting against wasn't something i would act against
they want the intellectualization part to be over


if he forgives or not its proof when i can feel again 


more often than not i dont feel like socializing
i feel like being on my own
i was dependant on my solittude just as bukowski was
this may sound crazy for the sound mind but nothing that a phd wont solve 


no more drugs
no more wanks
no more quickpaths to pleasure
no more relief
more stress and  voluntary suffering

i was asking this person not to give away her tablet

i was throwing boggies o the see to resolve a diplomacy promblem unresolved formany times before
