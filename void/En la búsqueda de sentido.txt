Charles is being kind to a child. He hands her a flower for her mother that is dying. She thanks him and goes away. And he wishes her a sooner death. But then he thinks: “well it is not that bad. I can charge my next client double”. And so he began to rewrite the tag in every flower. Then a woman came. She was pretty. Not so much but pretty much pretty. He thought this could be a chance for him to be liked by someone else than himself. 
“Hello, lady”, he asked. 
“Hello, you”.

The king sitting at his throne, eats grapes and shits grapes. He’s all about getting money. He’s all about power. He’s all in. He’s all wrong. He’s all one. He has two massive bullballs: there where he sits, he shits; but there where he sits, does not belong to him. 


“I’m not drawning because I want to.”, he said. “I just need more time to think”.


Is this poetry? It certainly is not. But does it sound good? I certainly cannot tell right now. 


Five swords. 
El bully finalmente, desarmó a su víctima. Sonreía al verlo caminar de espaldas. Evitarlo. Pero lo que no dejaba ver tampoco eran sus manos. Y con sus manos lo sorprendió un día, cuando no estaba mirando.
